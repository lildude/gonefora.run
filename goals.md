### Personal Bests

I was once a fast runner. Then I stopped, picked it up again, and now find myself a fast runner again.  Here are my all time personal bests:

### Goals

Note: This is old information, but I'm keeping it here for posterity.

To try and motivate me and keep track of my running progress, since returning to running after an extended break, I drew up a list of goals I wanted to achieve.  This was a progression from running with shoes to running without or in a pair of Vibrams or other minimalist "shoe".  I'd run all of these distances, and further, in shoes and I wanted to do it barefoot or in minimalist shoes, in a slow and structured way so as not to burn out or injure myself.

I didn't put a target date on any of these as I didn't want to push myself or become a slave to my goals.

\* - This wasn't the actual date.  This is just the date I realised I'd been doing it for a while and hadn't actually remembered to update this table.  
\+ - It was a race, but mainly on grass as opposed to on the road.
