<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, gonefora.run collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The purpose of collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use this website. From time to time, I may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>gonefora.run also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. gonefora.run does not use such information to identify its visitors and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to gonefora.run choose to interact with gonefora.run in ways that require gonefora.run to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that gonefora.run gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, visitors may choose to comment on an article and are asked to provide a name and email address. In each case, gonefora.run collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with gonefora.run. gonefora.run does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>gonefora.run discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on gonefora.run’s behalf or to provide services available at gonefora.run, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using gonefora.run, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. I, Colin Seymour, will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, I disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when I believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of gonefora.run, third parties, or the public at large. If you send me a request, such as via the contact form on gonefora.run, I reserve the right to publish it in order to help clarify or respond to your request or to help support other users, unless you explicitly ask for the email to not be disclosed publicly. gonefora.run takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. gonefora.run uses cookies to help gonefora.run identify and track visitors, their usage of the gonefora.run website, and their website access preferences. gonefora.run visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using gonefora.run, with the drawback that certain features may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, gonefora.run may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at my sole discretion. I encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
