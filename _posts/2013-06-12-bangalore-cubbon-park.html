<p>Just got back from my first run in Bangalore's Cubbon Park and I can say we're spoilt in the UK, USA, Europe & RSA when it comes to the paths and grassy patches. Today's run felt a bit like a flat cross-country run, even though I was running on the prepared paths. One section of crazy paving lived up to its name; it was like playing hop-scotch mid-run. Still good to be out on my feet.</p>
