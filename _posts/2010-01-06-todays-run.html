<p>I've just popped out for a short run and thought I'd document it for everyone to share.</p>
<p>First, the planned route:</p>
<p><a href="http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/Snow-Route/758780173_WH6kf-XL-1.jpg"><img class="center" src="/img/758780173_WH6kf-M-1.jpg" alt="758780173" title="Snow Route - Today's planned route.  As you can see, it's not a popular one today." width="300" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, it's not a popular route today, so it should be a nice quiet run.</p>
<p>I set off with good intentions, sadly any chances of actually running were soon stifled by the 9 inches of snow I quickly encountered...</p>
<p><span class="center"><a href="http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/Hey-Whered-my-Foot-Go/758780262_ykbDs-XL-1.jpg"><img src="/img/758780262_ykbDs-Th-1.jpg" alt="758780262" title="Hey!!

<p>So I turned back and headed for home, leaving nothing behind me but my foot prints.</p>
<p><span class="center"><a href="http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/The-Finished-Route-1/758780349_cxZpb-XL.jpg"><img src="/img/758780349_cxZpb-S.jpg" alt="758780349" title="The Finished Route (1) " width="200" height="300" /></a> <a href="http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/The-Finished-Route-2/758780388_UGCSS-XL.jpg"><img src="/img/758780388_UGCSS-S.jpg" alt="758780388" title="The Finished Route (2)  - All of 5 meters at the very most." width="200" height="300" /></a></span></p>
<p>Yes folks, I went for a run (read trudge) barefoot in the snow.  Sadly, it wasn't a long one - all of 5 meters at the very most - and not really running, but it was enjoyable none-the-less.  One thing is for sure, I thought my feet were cold before I went out, now they feel positively roasting now I'm back.</p>
