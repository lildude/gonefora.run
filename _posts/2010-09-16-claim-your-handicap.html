<p>You know those men and women who wear funny trousers and wonder around large swathes of the countryside all through the year on a never ending mission of attaining the illusive "scratch handicap"?  Yes? Ah, but do you really? If you're thinking I'm referring to golfers, think again.</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to the new breed of British runners, yes runners, who now have a handicap. <a href="http://www.runbritain.com/" target="_blank">runbritain</a> has just introduced a new handicap scoring system that is designed to give road runners of all abilities the ability to benchmark their progress and compare their results across a range of distances and terrains.</p>
<p>To quote the runbritain Rankings site:</p>
<blockquote><p>The scoring system, which has been developed in conjunction with the team behind the McCain Power of 10 website, rewards regular racing and factors in a degree of difficulty for slower courses. The score is derived from your results at 5K, 10K, Half Marathon &amp; Marathon during 2010 and thereafter on a rolling 12 month basis although you only need to have done one race in 2010 to claim a handicap.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once <a href="http://www.runbritainrankings.com/user/claimhandicap.aspx" target="_blank">registered</a>, you just need to enter at least one race you've run this year and then be amazed at your handicap which will be in the range of -2 for the elites and 36 in 0.1 increments.  Keep adding race results and watch your handicap adjust.</p>
<p>Everytime you login, you'll be taken to your personal biography page which displays:</p>
<ul>
<li>current rankings at each distance</li>
<li>personal progress graph</li>
<li>direct comparisons with other runners with a 'head-to-head' function</li>
<li>handicap score updated automatically after each run</li>
<li> target times to bring score down to the next level</li>
<li>training schedules to help you achieve your targets</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you haven't done so already, head on over to <a href="http://www.runbritainrankings.com/" target="_blank">runbritain Rankings</a> and claim your handicap.  Oh and don't forget to bring up your handicap when chatting over that ice cold beer after your next race.</p>
<p>For the curious, my handicap after three 5k Parkruns and two 10k races is...</p>

<p>... with all races done completely barefoot.  Not bad if I say so myself. Now to see how I can get this automatically updating in the sidebar of this site.</p>
