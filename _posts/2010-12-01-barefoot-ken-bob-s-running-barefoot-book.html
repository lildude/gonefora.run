<p><em>The Complete Book of Barefoot Running: Learn the Scientifically Proven Technique for Improving Your Stride and Reducing Injuries</em> (a bit of a mouthful) is now available for pre-order and <a href="http://therunningbarefoot.com/?p=7214" target="_blank">it looks like it'll be out</a> in time for next year's Boston Marathon (18 April 2011). AND it'll be available in the UK, so no need to hunt the internet for a UK reseller or pay over the odds for shipping.</p>
<p>I think of all the barefoot running related books release since <a href="/book-born-to-run-by-christopher-mcdougall">Born to Run</a>, I think this one may be the most thorough and informative.  After all, Ken Bob is probably the most experienced barefoot runner out there and experience counts for a lot.  His <a href="http://therunningbarefoot.com/" target="_blank">website</a> is a continual source of information for many runners, including me, so I've got high hopes of this book becoming my font of knowledge when I can't or don't want to access the internet to look something up.</p>
