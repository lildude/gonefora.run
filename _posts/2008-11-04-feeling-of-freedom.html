<p>I've just got back from a nice run back on the road in my Vibrams and what a feeling.  It's sooooo good to be back on the road instead of running on the treadmill in the gym.  </p>
<p>Yes, I don't quite have as much control over my pace and the distance I run, but who cares.  The feeling of freedom far out weighs the metrics.  Anyway, <a href="http://www.mapmyrun.com">mapmyrun.com</a> does a good job of measuring the distance.</p>
<p>Today's run: about 2.92km in 13:43 which works out at about 4:41/km.  Not bad.</p>
