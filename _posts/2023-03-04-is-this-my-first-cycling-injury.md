title: Is this My First Cycling Injury?

I somehow hurt my left hip at the beginning of February and havenâ€™t been able to do much exercise since. Itâ€™s still too tender to run but I have this week found I can row without upsetting it but cycling is definitely an aggravator. This isnâ€™t too surprising as 25spm is a lot less hip action than 90rpm but it does make me thinkâ€¦ have I just succumb to my first ever cycling injury (that didnâ€™t involve road rash or being run over)? I upped the intensity with a new training plan on TrainerRoad this year so maybe things arenâ€™t quite right with my setup and I need a bike fit ðŸ¤”
