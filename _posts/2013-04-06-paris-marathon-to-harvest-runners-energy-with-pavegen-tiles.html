<p>Check out what they're doing at the Paris marathon this weekend...</p>
<blockquote><p>Paris Marathon organizers will lay energy-harvesting tiles across the course on Sunday to ensure not all the effort expended by the race’s 40,000 runners goes to waste.</p>
<p>The flexible tiles made from recycled truck tires will span a portion of the Champs Elysees for about 25 meters (82 feet) of the 42.2-kilometer course, according to Pavegen Systems Ltd., the U.K. maker of the tiles. Each footstep generates as much as 8 watts of kinetic energy, which is fed back to batteries that can charge display screens and electronic signs along the route, the company said.<br />

<p>What a brilliant idea and definitely something I think should be deployed more often, and not just in road races, everyday life too.  Anywhere you have moving traffic of any source is potentially a location to harvest energy.</p>
