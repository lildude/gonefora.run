<p>Over on my personal site I've just written about <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/try-something-new-for-30-days" target="_blank">Matt Cutt's brilliant idea of doing or not doing something for 30 days</a> straight.  Given today is the first of the month so as good a time as any, I'd decided I'm going to do my own little challenges.</p>
<p>I'm starting with something easy...</p>
<p><strong>I'm going to run at least 3km everyday for 30 days</strong></p>
<p>Now as I mentioned in my post, this shouldn't be too hard to achieve on Monday to Friday, but the weekends may prove a bit tough.  As it's only 3km, I should be able to easily squeeze in a run.</p>
<p>As with all my training, I'll be logging everything in my <a href="http://www.fetcheveryone.com/userprofile.php?id=32814&show=training" target="_blank">training diary on Fetcheveryone.com</a>.</p>
<p>I'm quite excited about this challenge, not just for the challenge of doing something new, but to see what kind of impact this will have on my running.</p>
