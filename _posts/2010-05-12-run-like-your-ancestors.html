<p><a href="http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/RunLikeYourAncestors/864936795_VyzkP-XL.jpg"><img class="alignleft" src="/img/864936795_VyzkP-127x180.jpg" alt="Run Like Your Ancestors" width="127" height="180" /></a>Way back in February, I was approached by Jana Witt, a Science Communication student at the <a href="http://www.uwe.ac.uk/">University of the West of England</a> asking if I minded answering a few questions for an article she was writing for their student newspaper - <a href="http://www.westerneye.net/">The Western Eye</a> - (Jana is  science correspondent) inspired by the recently published <a href="/my-thoughts-on-the-lieberman-paper">Liberman paper</a>.</p>
<p>Being the nice person that I am, and eager to promote barefoot running, I gladly answered Jana's questions.  I think I went a little overboard on some of my answers as I would have smashed Jana's article word limit had she published my responses verbatim, but she got the gist of my answers and put together a great short article for her readers which was published in the March 2010 edition.</p>
<p>Jana has kindly provided a copy of just the article in <a href="http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/RunLikeYourAncestors/864936795_VyzkP-X2.jpg">JPG</a> and <a href="/img/RunLikeYourAncestors.pdf">PDF</a> formats for you to read too (2 months ago: I completely forgot to publish this back then, sorry Jana). </p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
