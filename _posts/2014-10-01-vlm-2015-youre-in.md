Look what the postie just bunged through my letterbox:

![VLM 2015 You're In](/img/youre-in.jpg)

I have to admit that I was expecting this as I already knew my Good For Age entry had been accepted, but it's still exciting to see this magazine and not [this one](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/By2slB1IYAAb0Hs.jpg:large).

I've got a sudden urge to go out for a run now ðŸ˜€
