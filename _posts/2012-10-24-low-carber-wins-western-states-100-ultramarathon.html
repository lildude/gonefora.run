<p>STEVE PHINNEY:  That’s correct.  His name is Tim Olson.  He lives in Oregon, and he says he made the transition to low-carb about a year or so ago.  Tim won a 100 mile race, I think, in late fall or early winter, and so he had already demonstrated he can do the event on low-carb and when he came into this Western 100 race, his goal was not just to do the race.  He stated in advance that his goal was to win it.  So he ran at the front of the race.  He was running with a number of other very accomplished male competitors — people who had done this race before and placed well before.  Somewhere between mile 65, well,  he went through the checkpoint at mile 65 a couple minutes ahead of the next guy, and there were a group of of four runners who were within four of five minutes of each other around them.  But when he passed the checkpoint at mile 85, he had opened the gap somewhat.  Then between mile 85 and 100  — and keep in mind, by mile 85 Tim Olson has already run the equivalent of over three marathons — somewhere in those final 15 miles, Tim Olson opened up an an additional 15 minute gap between himself and all the other runners.  That means, after running 85 miles, he was able to put on a burst of speed at the end of the race, and he finished 15 minutes ahead of his next closest competitor.<br />

<p>Not only did he win by over 15 minutes, he smashed 21 minutes off the course record.</p>
<p>As time goes on, more and more athletes and the world has a whole are starting to realise there has to be something in this <abbr title="low-carb, high-fat">LCHF</abbr> diet.  I've been following a LCHF diet for about 6 months now and seen nothing but great results.</p>
