<img class="alignleft" src="/img/parkrun50.jpg" alt="parkrun 50 club" width="169" height="151" /> It's taken me four years and eight months and I've finally done it.  I can now proudly say I'm now a member of the [parkrun 50 club](http://www.parkrun.com/about/our-clubs/50club/).

Waaaay back on 23 May 2010, I _didn't_ don my running shoes and ran my first ever parkrun, and ran it [completely barefoot](/reading-parkrun-barefoot).  Since then I've run three more completely barefoot and all the rest in a variety of minimalist shoes - the stony & rocky parts of the Reading course became a hinderance to my times ðŸ˜‰.

It's been a great 4+ years and I've grown to really love parkrun and have decided this year I'll be trying out a wider variety of parkruns - I've already done 4 different parkruns in 5 weeks.  I also plan to do the local parkruns, where available, when I'm travelling, which will be much easier now [San Francisco has one](http://www.parkrun.us/crissyfield/) - I'm often in San Francisco.

So without much further ado, here are a few statistics from my 50 parkruns.

* 4 run completely barefoot
* 7 different parkruns: [Reading](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/) (40), [Woodley](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/woodley/) (2), [Delta Park](http://www.parkrun.co.za/delta/) (2), [Black Park](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/black-park/) (2), [Newbury](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/newbury/) (2), [Frimley Lodge](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/FrimleyLodge/) (1), [Rushmoor](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/rushmoor/) (1)
* 11 personal bests
* 3 first places
* Lowest position: 16, my very first parkrun
* Fastest time: `17:10` at Reading
* Slowest time: `21:43` at Delta Park - I blame altitude and it's a tough course.
* Favourite parkrun: Delta Park. It's a challenging course with tons of nostalgia attached as I used to run school cross-country in Delta Park.

My next target is the 100 club, though I plan to join that club in a significantly quicker timeframe... just over a year should do it ðŸ˜€.
