![Week in Review: 23 - 29 May '16](/img/week-in-review-23-29May16.png){:height="150" width="840" class="center"}

Still on holiday this week so not much running but still loads of swimming, relaxing, drinking and eating.

Only managed to get out for two easy runs and one tough run - hit the big hill again - but got in four long swims.
Found out the pool at the hotel is actually only 25m long, and not the 35m I originally thought, so I've adjusted all my previous log entries for those swims.

I had planned on going for a long run yesterday (Sunday) but thanks to a mechanical fault on the plane for our flight back from Mallorca we were stuck in Palma for an extra night thus only getting back home late yesterday and I really didn't fancy going out for a run.

All in all, I'm feeling quite well relaxed and rested and am looking forward to the slog ahead as I train for Berlin.
