<p>Jerusalem Cruisers with naked top - http://shammasandals.com/store/barefoot-running-sandals/jerusalem-cruisers</p>
<p>- Zero-Drop 6mm Vibram Moreflex sole, good cushioning without losing ground feel. Flexible and doesn't slap when running, though may sound it would when walking in them.</p>
<p>- Leather covering heel strap gives nice soft protection against heel. I never feel the straps here anyway.  Orig was quite thing and firm. New is softer and more flexible.</p>
<p>- Buckle to adjust up and down front of foot<br />
- Velcro fastening instead of buckle used by Lunas. Nice touch. Original pair had a gap between hooks and loops so ended up not being able to fasten. Newer version has the two right next to each other with longer loop strap.<br />
- New velcro fastening has come at the expense of a bit of comfort though - instead of there being a single long strap with the velcro attached, the velcro seems to be an additional bit added to the end of the strap which is rougher than the original strap and the sticking joining to new bit is very firm and scratchy.</p>
<p>- Not sure about the soft leather bit around the heel strap.  The only thing it seems to do is add weight to the heel strap which is likely to cause it to slip on most people.</p>
<p>Warriors</p>
<p>- can feel the straps on either side of my foot - likely to rub and lead to blisters on longer runs. Not sure if this is due to the width or the flexibility of the sole, but Luna Sandals are wider and firmer and I don't notice the straps on those.</p>
<p>Suggested changes for both:</p>
<p>- go back to the single length of strap from just above the top join to the very end and add the velcro to that like on the original pair.<br />
- widen the foot base where the straps loop up on either side of the foot.<br />
- remove the leather covering on the heel strap</p>
