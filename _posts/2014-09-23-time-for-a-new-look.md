Well folks, I decided it was time for a new look here, so ðŸŽ‰ tadaaaa!!! ðŸŽ‰ What do you think?

Nice hey?  Not only is it a new look, it's a new backend too. I've switched this site from [Habari](http://habariproject.org/en/) to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on <del>[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - I work for GitHub so I may as well start using their stuff ðŸ™‚</del> my own server now as I forgot I can't use HTTPS on GitHub Pages yet.

Things aren't quite 100% as I'd like them, but I thought I'd dive in the deepend and just do it and fix up the mess as and when I notice it.
