<p>I worked from home yesterday and decided I'd go for a gentle walk up to the local park and back to get a bit of exercise and to keep my feet used to being barefoot.  On the way back I was approached by a little boy on his bicycle.  He greeted me, which was quite refreshing, and then asked "<em>Why aren't you wearing any shoes?</em>".  I replied: "<em>Because I don't want to hurt my feet</em>".  A puzzled look appeared on his face, a little pause and then he asked: "<em>How do you ride your bike then? It hurts if I don't wear shoes</em>".  He wasn't too interested in my response as he rode off, but his response made me smile.</p>
