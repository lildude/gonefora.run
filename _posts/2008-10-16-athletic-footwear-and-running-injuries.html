<p>A good article on the correlation of running injuries and the super-dooper high tech shoes on the market.</p>

<blockquote><p>Everything you and I always believed about running shoes and running injuries may be wrong!    Here's the scoop:  The modern running shoe itself may be the major cause of running injuries!  Stated another way, the modern running shoe, presently thought of a protective device, should be reclassified as a "health hazard".</p></blockquote>
<p>It's a couple of years old, but still some useful and valid information here.</p>
