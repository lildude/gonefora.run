![Week in Review: 19 - 25 Sep '16](/img/week-in-review-19-25Sep16.png){:height="240" width="840" class="center"}

So last week was it... the final week of a gruelling 17 week training programme I've been using to build up for the Berlin Marathon and it was a very easy week of running.

There's not much to report on the training side of things other than to say I took it really easy every day, with the exception of Wednesday which was mostly easy but also included 3K at marathon pace.

Suffice to say I was feeling fresh, recovered and really good on my feet and eager for the race on Sunday morning.  Sadly it didn't all go to plan ðŸ˜¢.

I won't go into too much detail about the race in this post as I've got a big post coming up, but severe cramping down my right leg started around the 25k mark and it was pretty much downhill from there.

Overall I'm chuffed to bits with the training programme - more details soon - and how well I coped and how well my body responded to the training.  It's just a pity something else kicked in on the day and smashed my goal and race into tiny little painful pieces.

As I said, more coming soon.
