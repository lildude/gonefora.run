<p>Somehow I missed this when I added my last training run, but check it out, I've tipped over the 1000km mark for my running this year:</p>

<p>Assuming I put in about 200km a month for the rest of the year (not likely), I could crack the 1000 mile mark this year.  I'm not going to aim for it, but we'll see how we get on.</p>
