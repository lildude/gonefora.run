<p>Merry Christmas everyone.  I hope you all have a fantastic Christmas.</p>
<p>For those in the northern hemisphere: if it's snowing near you, be sure to get out there barefoot, even if it's just for 10 paces down the path and back again. It's magical feeling the crunch of the powder below your feet. I did this the other day for the first time in my life when we had a huge snow fall in our area.</p>
<p>For those in the southern hemisphere or the tropics: I'd expect you've got your shoes off already, so sit back, relax, and mine's a Castle/Tooheys/Windhoek/Speight's/whatever you've got in the cooler ðŸ˜‰ .</p>
