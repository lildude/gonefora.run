Picked up the mileage a little this week from last but kept in two rest days.  Wasn't up for anything strenuous so no hard session this week.  I did however turn Thursday's two runs into a single long run as that afternoon was dedicated to meetings and the Reading beer festival.

Took Friday off, not because I'd had too much to drink the night before, but because I took the day off work too and headed over to see what Cheltenham was all about with my lovely lady.  Great relaxing day out and I think the extra rest day paid off on Saturday's parkrun as I smashed through the 18 minute mark for the first time this year.

I start the run off a little quick with the first kilometre in 3:27 but thought, "What the heck, I'm feeling great, lets see how it goes."  Well, it went well. I dropped into a slightly slower pace but kept things pretty consistent and felt great the whole way round.  Finished in 17:45, a 41 second improvement on my time from the 9th and my fastest parkrun since October last year.  I think this is another indicator the MAF and high mileage training is really working and I'm starting to see the results in the shorter events.  

I'll be cutting my training down a bit next week in time for Sunday's [Woodley 10k](http://www.barnesfitness.co.uk/event/woodley-10km).  It'll be interesting to see how more rest and the MAF training translates then. Watch this space.
