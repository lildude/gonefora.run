<p>Woohoo, good to see Reading parkrun has a temporary new home, though I'm very surprised it has taken flooding in TVP to get a parkrun at Dinton Pastures.  I would have thought Woodley parkrun would have jumped at the opportunity of being based out of Dinton Pastures than out of the teeny weeny little Woodford Park in the middle of Woodley.</p>
