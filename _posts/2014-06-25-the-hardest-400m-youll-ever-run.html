<p>I regularly have dreams where I'm running and find it so hard to run that I lean so far forward that I'm almost running on all fours, and it's still tough to run. Well imagine my surprise when I discovered I've probably been mentally training for what is probably the toughest 400m race in the world, let alone Europe... <a href="http://www.redbull.com/uk/en/stories/1331590542998/red-bull-400-planica" target="_blank">the Red Bull 400 in Planica, Slovenia</a>.</p>
<p>How's this for a brutal 400m race...</p>

<p>200m of elevation in just 400m. Think I'll add this to my bucket list given I've had so much practice in my dreams.</p>
