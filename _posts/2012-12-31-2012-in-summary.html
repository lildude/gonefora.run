<p>What a way to finish off this year's running: a very soggy and blustery 91 minutes round Chazey Wood.  With that done, I think it's a good time to sum up my running for 2012.</p>
<p>So what happened in 2012 in my little running world?  Well, lots.</p>
<h2>Training</h2>
<p>I started the year by switching my training to follow the maximum aerobic function (MAF) theory and method devised by Phil Maffetone (see my post <a href="/does-maf-training-work">Does Maximum Aerobic Function (MAF) Training Work?</a> post from Saturday for more details) and experienced tremendous returns.</p>
<p>As I was running all of my training aerobically, I found I was recovering incredibly quickly and soon found I could run for an hour or more many days on the trot, including after a 2-to-3 hour long run on a Sunday.  As a result my mileage climbed to levels I've never run before...</p>

</figure>
<p>As you can see, every month trumped the years before with 3 huge months: June, August and November, each over 300km.  I'm not quite sure what happened in February and March as I didn't log the days I didn't run (that'll be changing next year), didn't document any complaints in my logs and didn't post any blog posts to suggest a problem.  I know I had a holiday in the lake district and I tapered (unnecessary in hindsight) for <a href="/race-report-reading-half-marathon-2012">my first half-marathon in over 13 years</a> in March, but that shouldn't have entirely accounted for such a poor showing in March.  February we can probably blame on the weather - I've become much less of a fair-weather runner through the year ðŸ˜€ .</p>
<p>Within all this training are 5 weeks in which I covered more than 100km in each week with my biggest week being the week of 3 - 9 September when I clocked in 121.54km. Impressed?  I am ðŸ™‚ and I'm chuffed to bits with the fact 8 of the 12 months have totals over 200km and the total of 2823km for the year.  This is 823km MORE than I thought I'd cover when I set myself a target of 2000km for the year in January 2012.</p>
<p>So given the success I've had so far with this training, more on the effects on my racing coming up, I'm going to be sticking with this MAF training for a lot longer.  As I mentioned in Saturday's post, the only change I'll be introducing this year is a race-specific speed session once a fortnight.  I also plan to introduce a bit more strength work in the form of hills and full body weight sessions (got to get my money's worth in the gym) to the non-peak-racing parts of the year. Both will be closely monitored to see if they have a negative impact on my overall training and well-being.</p>
<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>After reading Phil Maffetone's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1616080655/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8" target="_blank">Big Book of Endurance</a>, I started to consider the merits of a lower carbohydrate diet.  I then read Tim Noakes's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1770221468/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8" target="_blank">Challenging Beliefs</a> and I was convinced this was something I had to try and put to the test so I adopted a "paleo-lite" diet as I mentioned in my <a href="/training-and-diet-update">mid-year update</a>.</p>
<p>After experiencing some very good results, I finally took the plunge and dropped the carbs almost entirely.  No more pre-long run or pre-race carbs (I was still consuming some "complex carbs" until about June); just good ol' fat and protein and lots of it and I've not looked back and I don't think I will.  Thus far I've not needed a stack of carbs before any of my runs and in fact I believe I now perform better by NOT having any carbs before I race.</p>
<p>So with a good 6 months of a low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet I can say this works for me as...</p>
<ol>
<li>I have lost weight without even trying.  You may say performing the MAF training would have done this, and you're probably right, but only partly.  Once I switched to a LCHF diet, the weight just fell off.  I started the year weighing 81kg and soon stabilised at 79kg.  I'm ending the year weighing 71kg with the biggest drop in their weight coming after I switched completely to the LCHF diet.</li>
<li>I noticed my endurance improved significantly.  Once again, the MAF would have contributed to this, but I think switching to the LCHF helped even more as fat is definitely a better fuel source for me than carbohydrates.</li>
<li>I experienced much better and more consistent energy levels.  I'm a lively chap most of the time, but I always found I had a slump around about 3pm each afternoon when I craved a choccy or some other quickfix carb snack - my will power was good so I very rarely gave in, but I still experienced the sugar low.  Things were particularly bad on the weekend when I tended not to have my mid-morning apple or banana.  I'd then enter the state my wife and I call "hangry".  It's when I'd get grumpy, snappy and agitated because of low sugar levels.  Not anymore.  I can breeze through the afternoon or Saturday morning's shopping without even noticing the time or feeling the slightest bit peckish.</li>
</ol>
<p>As an added bonus, my wife has switched to a LCHF diet with me, though with a bit less stringenc, and she too is reaping the benefits, except the running part - she's not a runner.  She does however miss the likes of bread (she's a huge marmite fan) and pasta more than me.</p>
<p>So as with the MAF training, this is something else I'll be keeping up and I definitely encourage you to consider it too.  If anything, get hold of a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1609611543/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8" target="_blank">Wheat Belly</a> and try giving up just wheat to start with and see the benefits.  The rest of the carbs will soon follow ðŸ˜‰ .</p>
<h2>Racing</h2>
<p>So you now know about my diet and training, what happened in the racing?  Well check out these times:</p>

<p>* The 2011 season half-marathon was actually run in April 2012 but as I didn't run a half-marathon last year, I've included it. </p>
<p>The 5k off-road and half-marathon are all-time personal bests according to my records.  I'm sure I've run 5km on-road quicker, but not off-road.  I'd also never run a half-marathon anywhere near 1h 20m before, let alone run under it and best of all, <a href="/should-i-be-running-a-10k-pb-in-a-half-marathon">that half-marathon included a 10k PB</a>. I can't wait for a nice fast 10k in 2013 to see if I can get a new all-time PB.</p>
<p>I can only put these great times down to the fantastic aerobic base the MAF training has given me and the adaptation of my body to a LCHF diet.</p>
<p>I am now running at a quicker pace than I was when I left South Africa at the ripe old age of 20.</p>
<h2>Plans for 2013</h2>
<p>With 2012 behind me and 2013 looming on the horizon, it's time to think about my goals for next year.</p>
<p>My first and probably biggest goal is to run a sub-3 hour marathon at the Milton Keynes marathon in May and thus qualify for the 2014 London Marathon well within the <a href="https://www.virginmoneylondonmarathon.com/en-gb/how-to-enter/good-age-entry/" target="_blank">"Good for age" limit of 3:10</a>.</p>
<p>Once that's out of the way I think I'll have a good go at the following goals...</p>
<ul>
<li>sub-17 5k</li>
<li>sub-36 10k</li>
<li>sub-78 1/2 marathon</li>
<li>run a 100km week at least once a month</li>
<li>exceed 3200km of running for the year - this isn't too important as I tend to train by time rather distance</li>
</ul>
<p>I think these are good attainable goals which are going to be tough to hit, but with some good training I think I might be able to accomplish them.  I'm also going to start logging the days when I don't run so I can understand the fluctuations in monthly totals and gauge the effects of my training more effectively.</p>
<p>I'm really enjoying my running at the moment and really hope next year is another bumper year.  Watch this space.</p>
