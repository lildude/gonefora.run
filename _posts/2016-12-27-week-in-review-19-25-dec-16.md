![Week in Review: 19 - 25 Dec '16](/img/week-in-review-19-25Dec16.png){:class="center"}

After Sunday's great success and confirmation my back was on the mend, I hit the road and bumped my mileage back up. I got in my miles early in the week as I knew Christmas was at the end of the week so no run would be on the cards and we were also meeting a few friends on Thursday evening, and after my last hangover run, there was no way I was going to risk going out on Friday.

Good week all in all. Nothing too taxing and it's still surprisingly warm. Quite pleased to still get in over 80km in only five days.
