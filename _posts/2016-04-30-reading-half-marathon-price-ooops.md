Early bird entries opened for the 2017 Reading half marathon and you'll never guess the early bird price for non-affiliated runners: Â£45!!  Yes, FORTY FIVE POUNDS!!... for a half marathon!! ðŸ˜²

As you'd expect, people turned to Twitter to express their disbelief which soon resulted in a change...

I think the "admin error" here is they revealed their cards too early. I suspect Â£45 is the normal extortionate "non-early bird" price they plan to charge closer to the event.

[Big business has been putting its grubby paws all over great events in the USA](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a21913/the-running-racket/) for many years, cranking the prices up with little reason and no improvement in return for the runners or local community, and now it's [becoming more and more prevalent in the UK](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/datablog/2015/mar/17/running-costs-what-are-the-worlds-most-expensive-marathons), with the likes of Vitality leading the way.

Vitality events are some of the most expensive races, per mile/km, in the UK now and the local clubs, community or runners don't get very much for the extra cost. The Reading and Oxford half-marathons used to be lovely affordable, moderately sized "clubby" races before Vitality got involved.  Now they're hellish expensive, big money-making ventures which somehow pull in significant numbers of runners - maybe this little "ooops" may make people think twice, but I doubt it.

I'd love to say that I won't be running any of these big business sponsored events in the future, but I can't as some of the races on my bucket list are now heavily sponsored with silly entry fees with little in return.  I can say that I will always choose a smaller club-run, UKA licensed event, over one of these rip-off events wherever possible, and continue to hope the likes of the Wokingham half and the Abingdon marathon, both brilliant, affordable well organised club events, _don't_ become money-making events for big business.
