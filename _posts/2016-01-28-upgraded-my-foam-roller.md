Oh... my... word...  what a fantastic roller.  It is incredibly firm and you can really feel the little nodules and ridges and smooth bits that are meant to mimic fingers and palms etc. My glorified [pool noodle](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=pool+noodles&safe=strict&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_-tqR5MzKAhWCShQKHTWtAT4QsAQIXg&biw=1280&bih=701&dpr=2) has been relegated to being something I sit on whilst eating my dinner at the coffee table.
