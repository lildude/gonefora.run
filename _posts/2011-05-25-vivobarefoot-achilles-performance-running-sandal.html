<p>I've just received this <a href="http://communicatoremail.com/IN/cLXRXbND9K4zwL29ebtWFE5-v7W6xFYMB7n7LPgPuzO/WebView.aspx" target="_blank">newletter</a> from Terra Plana in which they announced these rather strange looking "fully moulded performance sandals"...</p>

<p>I'm intrigued.  I'm not sure I like them yet or not. I certainly don't like most of the colours other than the  <a href="http://www.vivobarefoot.com/uk/mens/achilles-m-3924.html/" target="_blank">grey</a> and possibly the <a href="http://www.vivobarefoot.com/uk/mens/achilles-m-3951.html/" target="_blank">white</a> ones.  I think I might need to see them in the flesh.  </p>
<p>Me thinks these are potentially the first foray into the world of huaraches by a proper shoe manufacturer, though way more engineered and accordingly may more expensive.</p>
