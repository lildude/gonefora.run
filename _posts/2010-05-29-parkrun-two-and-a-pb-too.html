<p>For the second week in a row that crazy nutter was there at the <a href="http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/">Reading Parkrun</a> running without any shoes.  Don't believe me?  Well check out the photos (<a href="http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/Photos.aspx">more here</a>):</p>

<p><!--more-->Things were a lot cooler this week thanks to the clouds and light drizzle, but I think it was more conducive to running.  I had a great run this morning, but unfortunately, I don't learn.  <a href="/reading-parkrun-barefoot">Last week</a> I mentioned I set off a bit fast, well this week I set off faster (3:25 for the first km) and found myself in the lead as we approached the bridge.  It was at this point I realised I was being silly and backed off a bit and settled into a pace of around 4:00/km - the pace I planned on running the whole race at. To be honest, I don't think I could have kept up a pace much quicker thanks to my blistering start.</p>
<p>That said, I can't really grumble too much about my fast start as it meant I managed to smash a whopping 28 seconds off my time from last week setting a new personal best (PB).  The overall pace of the race was a bit slower this week too, but I think everyone still had a great run.</p>
<p>So my <a href="http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/Results/WeeklyResults.aspx?runSeqNumber=36">results</a> this week were:</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> 19:41<br />
<strong>Overall Position:</strong> 14 / 127<br />
<strong>Age Category Position:</strong> 3rd</p>
<p>I think that's a good bit of speed work in preparation for Wednesday's <a href="http://www.yateley10kseries.info/">Yateley 10k</a>.  I'll be doing that barefoot (though probably not anywhere near as fast as this 5k) so if you're there, watch out for the crazy fool - I'll be the one in the red shirt ðŸ˜‰ </p>
<p>Oh yes, and don't forget: <a href="/follow-the-comrades-marathon-online">Comrades online</a> tomorrow morning.</p>
