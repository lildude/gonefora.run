This week has been a big fat binge recovery week in which I've eaten too much rubbish, drunk too much beer and run too little. Essentially I've been sobbing into my beer like a big baby.  On the plus side, I did get out for two runs before jetting off to Amsterdam for a work meetup and I've found a relatively flat marathon at the end of October in which I can take another stab at a good time for the year.
