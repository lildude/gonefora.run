<p><img class="alignright" alt="thruster" src="/img/fran.jpg" width="225" height="337" />So I'm not really running at the moment. Whilst in San Francisco in the last week of January I woke up one morning with a slightly tender right ankle. Being the silly arse that I am, I went for a run in the glorious sunshine.  A gentle 2km warm up seemed to loosen things up and I broke into my planned 800m intervals with 600m recovery along the Embarcadero.  This was a great workout, except for the recovery runs... my right ankle really wasn't too happy with those.</p>
<p>Well, to cut a long story short, I've not really gone much further than about 5km since as my right ankle keeps flaring up.  I suspect it's <a href="http://www.eorthopod.com/content/peroneal-tendon" target="_blank">peroneal tendonitis</a> but I've not gone to the doctors yet.  I'll give it a few more weeks before seeking expert advice.</p>
<p>Anyway, in order to stop myself becoming a great big fat lazy oaf and to try and keep some sort of semblance of fitness (and sanity) in the slight hope I might actually get to run enough to actually finish the <a href="http://www.shakespearemarathon.org.uk/" target="_blank">Shakespeare Marathon</a> at the end of April I've been cycling, swimming and going to the gym with the gym part being the most boring.</p>
<p><!--more--><br />
Today I got this crazy idea (Tom Williams from <a href="http://www.marathontalk.com/" target="_blank">Marathon Talk</a> is also partly to blame as he's incorporating CrossFit into his training this year) that I could try a few CrossFit exercises in the gym to get a bigger bang for my buck and found <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/009141.html" target="_blank">this</a> "Workout of the Day" (WoD):</p>
<p><img class="center" alt="WoD 140301" src="/img/WoD-140301.png" width="483" height="163" /></p>
<p>Sounds easy enough, except for the 95lb (approx 43kg) barbell part: there's no way I can do 5 thrusters at that weight - I can't get the weight over my head - let alone 45!!</p>
<p>Let me tell you something, I got this so so wrong.  I seriously misjudged this workout.</p>
<p>I'm by no means a CrossFit expert but I have speed-read the <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/faq.html" target="_blank">FAQ</a> and have a good idea of how to do most of the exercises from my old weightlifting days.  What I wasn't sure about was if I was meant to do this in "rounds" (ie 21 thrusters followed by 21 pull-ups etc) or in turn.  I thought rounds so that what I had in mind when I went to the gym.</p>
<p>Being cautious, I warmed up and then loaded an olympic bar with a massive 10kg - 5kg per side - taking the bar + weights to 30kg and hit my first set of 21 thrusters.</p>
<p>OH MY WORD!!! I nearly keeled over. I got to about 13 reps and was so out of breath I had to pause.  By the time I got to 21 I didn't have the breath or energy to hoik myself up to the pull-up bar for the pull ups.</p>
<p>In the end I did the thrusters with loads of rest between sets, then the pull-ups - only to failure - and called it a day.</p>
<p>When I got home I looked up this innocently sounding "Fran" workout and discovered this is one of the <a href="http://crossfitrosslyn.com/fran-tips-for-completing-this-benchmark-workout/" target="_blank">benchmark CrossFit workouts</a>. I also discovered I'm allowed, and actually encouraged to "cheat" in the pull-ups - it's called doing kipping pull-ups.</p>
<p>Want to see how this workout is done (nothing like how I did it)?, here you go:</p>
<p><iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WoWD5BsENTM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The kipping pull-ups look really odd to me, but I guess the idea it to keep the whole body working and not just the arms and back.</p>
<p>I've got my work cut out for me if I'm ever going to get up to doing these with 90lbs of weight without nearly killing myself. I do however now know this is a great one for measuring my progress and will definitely do this properly soon so I've got a benchmark to work from.</p>
