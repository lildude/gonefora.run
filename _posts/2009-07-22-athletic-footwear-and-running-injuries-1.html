<p>I think this is one of the best articles I've read that details the harmful effects of modern running shoes: <a href="http://www.quickswood.com/my_weblog/2006/08/athletic_footwe.html">Athletic Footwear and Running Injuries</a>.  It shares a common theme with the <a href="/the-painful-truth-about-trainers">article by Christopher McDougall</a> but it's presented as an essay, with more detail and includes a supporting reading list at the end.</p>
