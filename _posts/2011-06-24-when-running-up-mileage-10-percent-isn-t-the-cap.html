<p>I've been following and instilling the 10% rule for years for people starting out, especially when it comes to barefoot running, but I've always stated that this shouldn't be treated as a hard-and-fast rule.  Looks like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/health/nutrition/21best.html" target="_blank">research is on the way</a> to confirm that this doesn't really make much difference toward preventing injury.  I think it should still be followed when starting barefoot running: not for injury prevention, but to acclimatise your feet to the new sensations.</p>
