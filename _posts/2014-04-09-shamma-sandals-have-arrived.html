<p>Look what the postie dropped off today...</p>

<p>Two pairs of <a href="http://shammasandals.com/" target="_blank">Shamma Sandals</a>, my next foray into huaraches. I think the leather topped ones, called <a href="http://shammasandals.com/store/barefoot-running-sandals/warriors" target="_blank">Warriors</a>,  look particularly swish too.  </p>
<p>I'm taking a break from running this week to try and help the stress fracture in my right fibula heal properly but I hope to get out in these next week and give them a good thorough testing.</p>
