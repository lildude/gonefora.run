<p>Look what I happened to stumble across on the <a href="http://www.davidlloydshop.co.uk/store/yoga-pilates-mats/yoga/products/yoga-stick-e-socks/default.aspx" target="_blank">David Lloyd "shop"</a> website:</p>

<p>Apparently the "<em>exposed toes</em>" are "<em>for gripping and maintaining that barefoot feeling" and they "protect against fungus and communicable diseases</em>", except those that are transmitted via the ends of your toes - watch out for them, they're the deadliest ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>I wonder if the <a href="/barefoot-in-david-lloyd-gyms" target="_blank">manager of the gym will allow me to wear these in the gym in locations</a> <em>other</em> than the yoga classes.  They sell them, so they must be acceptable.  Not sure I'll spend over Â£15 for a pair of socks though, especially when these funky coloured yoga toe socks are half the price (I got my wife a pair and she loves them) and way more fun.</p>
<p>Given how popular yoga and pilates are and how "in tune" they are with being barefoot, I'm surprised gyms are still so iffy about being barefoot.</p>
