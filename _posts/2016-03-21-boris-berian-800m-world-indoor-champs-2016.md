It was with great delight that I watched the finals of the men's 800m at the World Indoor champs last night in which Boris Berian ran his 800m exactly like I did many a time in high school...

Yup, go out as hard as you can - it's a long sprint after all ðŸ˜‰ - and then hold on for dear life in the final stages of the race in the hope you've got the legs to keep you in the lead until the line.

I didn't think he'd do it as we so commonly see with people going out way too quick, but he did, and with a split of 49.73s for the first 400m and 56.1s for the second!
