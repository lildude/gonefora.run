<p>New Balance recently released an <a href="http://www.newbalance.com/performance/tony-krupicka-and-chris-wawrousek-talk-about-the-evolution-of-nb-minimus/" target="_blank">interview</a> between ultramarathon runner <a href="http://antonkrupicka.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Tony Krupicka</a>, a New Balance shoe designer Chris Wawrousek and someone acting on behalf of NewBalance.com that goes over the iterative design process behind the NB Minimus Trail shoe due out in 2011.  </p>
<p>Pretty interesting stuff, and I quite like the little slide show towards the end showing each of the iterative steps in the design process.  I like the fact they've actually taken a runner known for hacking his shoes to bits to get what he wants and asked him to give feedback.  This is great way to design a serious pair of minimalist shoes.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how these compare to the <a href="http://birthdayshoes.com/sneak-peak-at-the-merrell-barefoot-2011-collection" target="_blank">shoes Merrell plan on releasing</a> around the same time.</p>
