title: Experimented with the new TrainingPeaks to Coros Sync
---

Experimented with the new [TrainingPeaks to Coros workout sync functionality](https://support.coros.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052332691-How-to-download-workouts-and-training-plans-from-TrainingPeaks-to-your-COROS-watch) today and it works well. The only part that doesn't seem to work yet is Coros doesn't seem to support open-ended segments, ie those with the "End step on lap button" setting enabled.
