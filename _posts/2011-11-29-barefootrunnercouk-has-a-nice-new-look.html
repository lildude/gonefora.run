<p>Yes folks, it's time again for a new coat of paint on this website.  Actually, this is the first new coat of paint on here since I launched it way back in September 2008 and I've decided to go for a super lean and mean look and layout.</p>
<p>For those reading this via a feed, you'll have to pop by to see the new design.</p>
<p>Let me know if you spot any problems.</p>
