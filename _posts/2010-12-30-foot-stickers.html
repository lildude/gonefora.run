<p>Now this is an interesting concept: <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/12/foot-stickers-the-most-minimal-sneakers-around/" target="_blank">foot stickers</a>...  </p>

<p>Why wear a whole shoe when all you need is a little protection on the bottom of your feet? A great idea, though I think it may not be particularly practical to implement, especially for outdoor use. You'd need to invent some pretty impressive sticky stuff that is water and sweat proof and yet easily removable from the skin without the need for solvents etc.  Ideally this would need to be re-usable, though not essential.</p>
<p>It would also need to come off fingers easily so you could actually let go of your foot stickers once you've taken them off your feet ðŸ˜€</p>
