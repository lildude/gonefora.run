<p>I've just come back from my first completely barefoot run and WOW!!!  It felt fantastic to feel so free and to really feel the earth beneath my feet.  It was also very surprising how comfortable it was at first.  </p>
<p>I managed to run in my normal style for about 1.5km on tarred pavements before the bottoms of my feet really started to feel uncomfortable with the new surface.  I then finished off with another 1.5km or so on grass, just to give myself and feet a good workout.</p>
<p>I think I'll leave it at least a week before I have another go completely barefoot.  One thing is for sure, I think it's here to stay.</p>
