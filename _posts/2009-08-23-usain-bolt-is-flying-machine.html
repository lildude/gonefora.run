<p>I've just watched a quick highlights snip on the BBC showing Usain Bolt's amazing 100m (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/8204505.stm">BBC</a> / <a href="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/watch?v=By1JQFxfLMM">YouTube</a>) and even more spectacular 200m (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/8213185.stm">BBC</a> / <a href="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/watch?v=9EiPCfPROtE">YouTube</a>) races at the World Champs in Berlin this week.</p>
<p>This man is a flying machine, not a running machine.  Take note of his times: 9.58 sec and 19.19 sec respectively.  Notice something extra-ordinary?  His 200m is only a fraction more than double his 100m time.  I'd say once he's going, he's pretty much going at a constant speed for at least 160m of his 200m (assuming it takes him 40m to get up to speed).  Imagine his times if he could take a running start to both races or even if he could keep this going for a full 400m.</p>
<p>Actually, come to think of it, if we did a very crude and overly simplified calculation we can probably guess what he's capable of over 400m:</p>
<p>First some assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>He starts all events at the same speed and takes 40m to reach top speed</li>
<li>He maintains a constant speed (neigh on impossible, but we're looking at an ideal situation) for 360m of his 400m race</li>
<li>He only slows by 3 5 1/100ths of a second for every successive 100m</li>
</ul>
<p>This would give him a time of 38:41 sec.  He'd smash Michael Johnson's  world record (43.18 sec) by nearly 5 seconds. He'd beat it even if we assumed he'd lose a whole second per 100m.  Now that's impressive.</p>
<p>Sadly, I don't think he'll be moving up to the 400m any time soon, nor do I think he'd actually be able to attain such a time - he is a man after all, not a machine, but I'm certainly looking forward to his future races.</p>
