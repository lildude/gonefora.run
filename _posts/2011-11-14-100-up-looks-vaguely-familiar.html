<p>A couple of weeks ago Chris McDougall caused another little stir in the barefoot/minimalist running world with an article for The New York Times entitled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/magazine/running-christopher-mcdougall.html" target="_blank">The Once and Future Way to Run</a>.  Within this article he mentions something called the 100-Up exercise...</p>
<blockquote><p>Earlier this year, I may have found it. I was leafing through the back of an out-of-print book, a collection of runners’ biographies called “The Five Kings of Distance,” when I came across a three-page essay from 1908 titled “W. G. George’s Own Account From the 100-Up Exercise.” According to legend, this single drill turned a 16-year-old with almost no running experience into the foremost racer of his day.</p>
<p>I read George’s words: “By its constant practice and regular use alone, I have myself established many records on the running path and won more amateur track-championships than any other individual.” And it was safe, George said: the 100-Up is “incapable of harm when practiced discreetly.”</p>
<p>Could it be that simple? That day, I began experimenting on myself.</p></blockquote>
<p>[... two pages later ...]</p>
<blockquote><p>Last fall, at the end of a local 10-mile trail race, I surprised myself by finishing five minutes faster than I had four years ago, when I was in much better shape. I figured the result was a fluke — until it happened again. No special prep, awful travel schedule and yet a personal best in a six-mile race.</p>
<p>“I don’t get it,” I told Cucuzzella this past June when we went for a run together through the Shepherd University campus in Shepherdstown. “I’m four years older. I’m pretty sure I’m heavier. I’m not doing real workouts, just whatever I feel like each day. The only difference is I’ve been 100-Upping.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Naturally, this last bit got everyone excited and within days, Justin of <a href="http://birthdayshoes.com/" target="_blank">Birthday Shoes</a> fame, knocked up a dedicated site - <a href="http://hundredup.com/" target="_blank">HundredUp</a> - to raise awareness and put out <a href="http://hundredup.com/the-100-up-challenge/" target="_blank">a challenge</a> to people to try it themselves for 30 days and report back.</p>
<p>Naturally, as I'm keen on learning about improving my performance, I read through McDougall's article, watched the video, and read through the HundredUp site.  McDougall's demonstration of the exercise in the <a href="http://video.nytimes.com/video/2011/11/02/magazine/100000001149415/the-lost-secret-of-running.html" target="_blank">video in the NYT</a> article instantly rang bells, but I couldn't place why.</p>
<p>It was only this weekend that I worked it out... this is a lot like the "tapping" and "change of support" exercises from POSE running, except with more emphasis on high knees than on bringing the foot up under your body.</p>
<p>Compare for yourself.  First, the 100-Up video which shows the minor and major:</p>

<p>Next, the tapping and change of support exercises from POSE (the commentary is in German, but you're only meant to be looking at the pictures 😉)...</p>

<p>Interesting stuff. Of course there will be some overlap in methods taught - I'm sure Chi Running probably has a similar exercise too - and for all I know, Dr. Romanov could have taken some of his inspiration from W.G. George's 100-ups.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasoning, I think any exercise that encourages people to land on their mid-foot or forefoot and that strengthens the muscles and tendons around that area is better than nothing at all.</p>
