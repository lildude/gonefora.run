<p>I've just caught up on the coverage of the men's 5000m final at the 2011 Daegu World Champs and Mo Farah is on fire.  Fantastic last lap...</p>

<p>Mo Farah has incredible speed left in his legs at the end of the 5000m.  It's pretty amazing.  Great work and I think this makes up for being <a href="/amazing-finish-in-the-men-s-10000m-at-the-2011-daegu-world-champs" target="_blank">pipped at the line in the 10,000m</a>.  2 golds in the Olympics?  We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I actually know someone who ran in that race: Alistair Cragg.  His dad used to coach us when we both lived back in South Africa. I think he had an OK race.  He started off very well but got left in the dust when the pace picked up quite considerably at about 2600m.  He ended up finishing 14th over-all and got a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/14780934.stm" target="_blank">whole article for his efforts on the BBC</a>.</p>
