<p>Surely these can't be for real.  They look like condoms for feet and until such time as my feet become reproductive organs, I won't be wearing these.  That said, some of the other <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/113178689480167828171/Inov8ShocZone#5481914102558408258">upcoming Inov-8</a> products look appealing.  The green ones on the far right are apparently called "BARE-GRIP 200" with a 0mm lift throughout.  These could be the perfect cross-country/trail shoe for the barefoot runner wanting a little bit of off-road protection.</p>
