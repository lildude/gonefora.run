<p>Well, as promised, today I went for my first barefoot run on my quest to running completely shoe free.  It wasn't anything hectic, and deliberately so.  It was just a simple 5 minutes @ 2% incline @ 6mph on the treadmill after a challenging gym workout.</p>
<p>I'm starting slow and in the gym as it's convenient at the moment and also I need to strengthen the muscles and bones in my feet before pounding the tar.</p>
