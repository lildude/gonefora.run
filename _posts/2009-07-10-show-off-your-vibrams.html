<p>I've just recently stumbled upon a great site dedicated to the world of "<em>feet as they were designed to beâ€”unshod and free</em>" with a big dedication to Vibram Five Fingers - <a href="http://birthdayshoes.com/">birthdayshoes.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you're feeling apprehensive about going out in your Vibrams (you shouldn't be: I wear mine all the time when I'm not at work or barefoot and have only had 1 comment, from a toddler of all people), take a squizz through this site and see all the pictures people have submitted of them in their <acronym title="Vibram Five Fingers">VFF</acronym>.  And once you've ventured out, <a href="http://birthdayshoes.com/index.php/submit-pics-of-your-b-day-shoes">send Justin a pic of your VFFd feet</a> and get your feet on t'internet.  </p>
<p>I've not done this yet as I haven't been anywhere interesting in them yet, but I plan to once I get back from my holiday in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&ll=45.860369,6.308899&spn=0.841608,1.551819&z=10">Lake Annency</a> region of French Alps next month.</p>
<p><small>(I have no affiliation with birthdayshoes.com, I just love the whole concept of VFFs and thought I'd share a link and show some link love)</small></p>
