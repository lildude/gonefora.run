<p>I'm taking a bit of a break from running at the moment to let my lower legs repair and recover a bit.  I've been going a bit <abbr title="Yiddish for crazy">mashuga</abbr> recently and haven't really given my feet and legs a chance to recover properly.  As a result the little niggles one can expect from first starting running barefoot (or almost) are not clearing up completely between runs.  I don't want these to develop into full on injuries, so I'm taking another enforced break from running.</p>
<p>Now I don't want to just stop exercising completely and sit on my arse, however I do still want to keep my cardio levels up and use this time to burn off as much fat as I can.  Moving to barefoot (or almost) has meant I've had to keep my mileage quite low, so I don't really get a chance to burn much of my excess weight off.  I've been putting in some time in the gym between runs, but it's not been enough - I've noticed my weight creeping back up.</p>
<p>So I'm using this enforced break from running to try out this "Tabata technique/protocol" I've read about in various places on the net.</p>
<p><!--more-->The Tabata protocol was devised by Dr. Izumi Tabata and his team at the National Institute of Fitness and Sports in Tokyo and is a 4 minute intense set made up of 8x 20 second maximum intensity intervals with 10 seconds rest between each interval.</p>
<p>I started off with this and soon found just one 4 minute workout was no where near enough for me.  I hardly built up a sweat in those 4 minutes, so I've extended it a bit further and devised the following training regime.</p>
<div class="alert"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Do not jump straight into this workout.  This is what I do.  You may not be able to do this straight away, so start gently and slowly. You will hurt afterwards and I don't want to be responsible for hurting someone or for causing a heart attack.</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monday</strong>: 30 minute tabata rowing intervals comprised of:
<ul>
<li><em>2 mins slow and very gentle rowing</em> (this is my warm up too)</li>
<li><em>4 min tabata set</em> (20 sec as fast as possible, 10 sec slow or stopped, repeat x8)</li>
<li><em>Repeat the above 6 mins 5 times making a total of 30 mins</em></li>
<li><em>Cool down and stretch</em> (I don't time this as some days I cooldown quicker than others)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tuesday</strong>: Full body tabata gym workout comprised of:
<ul>
<li><em>Warm up</em></li>
<li><em>3 sets of hanging pullups</em>. I use good controlled form here and do as many reps as I can per set. I stop when I can't get my chin over the bar anymore.</li>
<li><em>2 sets of 4 min tabata clean and press</em> (20 sec of reps, 10 sec stopped, repeat x8) with a 2 min rest between each set. I don't do the olympic bum-to-floor style, I just life the barbell to my shoulders and then press it over my head.  That's one rep.</li>
<li><em>2 sets of 4 min tabata machine chest press</em> (20 sec of reps, 10 sec stopped, repeat x8). I use a machine here to be safe.  My arms and chest may get very very tired and I really don't fancy dropping a weight onto my face or chest.</li>
<li><em>2 sets of 4 min alternating lunges</em> (20 sec of reps, 10 sec stopped, repeat x8).  I hold a dumbell in each hands for these.  I use lifting straps too as my grip would give long before I'm finished each set.</li>
<li><em>Cool down and stretch</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday</strong>: Rest - I want to lose weight, not kill myself</li>
<li><strong>Thursday</strong>: 30 mins tabata cycling intervals as per the rowing intervals</li>
<li><strong>Friday</strong>: Repeat Tuesday's workout.</li>
<li><strong>Saturday &amp; Sunday</strong>: Rest</li>
</ul>
<p>I've managed one week so far and boy is it tough, but I feel fantastic afterwards.  Each session burns in the region of 500-800kcal, depending on how much effort I put in and the weights etc involved and takes about 35-40 minutes.</p>
<p>With lack of running and my commitment to weightlifting over the years my weight has fluctuated from the rather lean 64kg I was when running as an 19 year to the mighty 98kg I weighed in the peak of my weightlifting phase. I now sit slightly towards the top end of this range at 89kg. I know I'll never get back to 64kg, and quite frankly really don't want to be that skinny again, but I do think I could get down to a more reasonable 75-85kg.   This enforced break, coupled with the fact I'm not drinking much beer at the moment (my wife and I are expecting our first child, so I'm being supportive by cutting back on the amount of beer I drink) and this pretty intense exercise regime, should help me towards that goal.</p>
<p>I'll keep you all updated.</p>
