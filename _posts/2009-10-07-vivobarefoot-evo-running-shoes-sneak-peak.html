<p>Looky looky what I received in my inbox from a kind lady at Terra Plana (click for full size):</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/photos/673118551_wiPwS-X2-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="center" src="/img/673118551_wiPwS-L-1.jpg" alt="VivoBarefoot Evo Press Release" width="426" height="600" /></a></div>
<p><!--more-->These look great and, whilst not as quirky or as outrageously different as the Vibram Five Fingers, I think the VVFs may be in for quite a challenge.  The proof will be in the testing when we can all finally get our hands on these early next year.  I'll be particularly interested in how they feel, wear and how well they cope in the one environment where VVFs don't do too well: the cold and wet of winter.</p>
<p>If you take a look at these individual shoe images, you'll see they look a lot like, though not identical to <a href="/vvf-alternative-coming-from-terra-plana">this picture</a> that appeared on Twitpics not too long ago...</p>

<img src="/img/673118562_oCWLb-S-3.jpg" alt="VivoBarefoot Evo in Yellow" width="362" height="231" /></div>
<p>Time to get saving: I might have to treat myself to a pair of these for a belated birthday present next year.</p>
