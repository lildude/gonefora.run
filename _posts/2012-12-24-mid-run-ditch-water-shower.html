<p>A very merry f***ing Christmas goes out to the white van driver who thought I needed a ditch-water shower right in the middle of my run along the A4 outside Twyford today.</p>
<p>You made absolutely no attempt to slow down or avoid the huge puddle. Instead you created an arching splash of about 10 feet in height that I couldn't avoid.  There is a <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/3ZA" target="_blank">law against this in this country</a>, but I guess as a stereo-typical white van driver you must think this only applies to other people.</p>
<p>I know this was probably very funny to you and I certainly laughed in disbelief (after I'd finished effing and jeffing and gesticulating at you) at just how inconsiderate you were.  I also had a chortle to myself when I got back when changing and discovered my jocks were soaking too, but that's not the point.</p>
<p>Anyway, as you're lucky enough to have disappeared before I could get your registration number and as it's Christmas I'll let you off.  I do however declare you officially on Santa's bad list and as you're a grown up, I transfer this to your kids.  I hope they wake you up nice and early tomorrow morning and then fall into a right grumpy mood and really get up your nose because Santa didn't bring them anything they wanted - they're on the bad list now after all ðŸ˜‰ .</p>
<p>Merry Christmas inconsiderate stereo-typical white van man.</p>
