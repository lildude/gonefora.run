<p>I'm not normally a fair weather runner, but this morning I am. It is tipping it down outside and it's cold. Normally I don't mind the rain and gauge if it's worth heading out by how hard it is raining and how wet I'm likely to be at the end of my run. This morning I woke up to find it tipping down and worked out that I'd be about 15 mins into my 2 hour run before I'd have wet undies. No thanks. An hour and three quarters of training with soggy jocks is not my idea of fun and enjoyment.</p>
<p>Think I'll wait until later in the day to see if it eases up. Until then a cup of tea with buffalo milk and some more duvet time are on the cards.</p>
