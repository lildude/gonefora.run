The time has come for me to acknowledge that I'm not worthy of being called a barefoot runner anymore ðŸ˜ž, and haven't been for quite some time. Accordingly, it appropriate that it's about time I change the name and domain of this site. I've changed a few colours here and there and optimised the site a bit too.

I'll continue writing all about running as I find things interesting and will still keep barefoot, natural and minimalist running in my repertoire, it'll just no longer be the name of this site.
