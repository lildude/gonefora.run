<p>Saw a great book in WH Smiths today...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/184744542X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=184744542X" target="_blank"><img class="center" alt="Run Fat B!tch Run" src="/img/runfatbithrun.jpg" width="261" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>I have no idea what the book is about other than it's about encouraging fat ladies to lose weight by running, but the title caught my attention and made me laugh.</p>
