<p>A <a href="http://www.runblogger.com/2010/10/repetitive-overuse-injuries-in-runners.html" target="_blank">great anecdotal discussion</a> about overuse injuries from Pete Larson @ <a href="http://www.runblogger.com" target="_blank">RunBlogger</a>.  My own experiences pretty much match what Pete details here, with the slight exception that I think my recent <a href="/tofp-probably-stress-fracture" target="_blank">injury</a> was actually due to a <a href="/september-update" target="_blank">problem with my hips</a>. Interesting thoughts about cycling your shoe wear.  I don't wear shoes often, but as we enter winter I'm contemplating shelling out for a pair of Vibram Bikilas - my classics are looking very sad.</p>
