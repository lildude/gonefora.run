I was thinking just the other day that I've not seen much in the way of changes or enhancements to Strava other than the odd tweak here and there. I was starting to get the feeling that they were taking peep's cash and keeping things ticking over whilst sponsoring events and athletes in the name of growing their brand without actually offering any new features or enhancements to their paying users.

Well, I can say my ponderings have been answered...  they've been beavering away behind the scenes making Strava's activity feed look like Twitter...

I'm glad to see Strava is still working on their site, I'm just a little disappointed that they've spent their time mimicking Twitter rather than coming up with something new or enhancing the features they offer, like some of the advanced features you get with TrainingPeaks.

**Update** It all falls into place now... [Strava launches posts to bring athletes back for everything else beyond their workouts](https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/17/strava-launches-posts-to-bring-athletes-back-for-everything-else-beyond-their-workouts/).
