<p>Home and clean after completing the Grizedale duathlon. What a tough event. Think this might be the toughest thing I've ever done. The cycle leg was the killer. Now I'm absolutely cream-crackered. I think every muscle in my body is going to hurt tomorrow. Will have to soothe with Cumbrian ales ðŸ™‚ </p>
