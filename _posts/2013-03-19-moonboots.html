<p>I thought these were a spoof when I first saw the image, but it appears they're a genuine product and the pair in the picture is trail shoe!?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hokaoneone.eu/en/technology.html" target="_blank">technology</a> in these shoes is impressive, in particular the explanation for the huuuuuuge drop...</p>
<blockquote><p>Up to 2.5x the volume of EVA in the midsole compared to standard running shoes. Outstanding impact absorption and a highly comfortable underfoot feel. nThis oversized approach ensures a natural stride whether on smooth road surfaces or the most uneven trails.</p></blockquote>
<p>A <em>natural stride</em> For who? An astronaut on the moon?  There's no way a boot like this could promote a natural stride in anyone.</p>
<p>These things are insane and expensive and the "technology" claims are spectacular.  I don't think I'll be migrating to these anytime soon.</p>
