<p>I went for my 2nd 5 min @ 2% @ 6mph run on the treadmill this afternoon, after my weight lifting session, and felt really good. So good in fact I was really tempted to push things and go for 10 mins or so.  But self control set in and I stopped at 5 mins.</p>
<p>I know I can easily do more from a cardio perspective, but I don't want to rush things.  SOOOO many times I've got the idea of getting running again into my head, got over eager and ended up injured or knackered.  All the running experts suggest a 10% increase on a week by week basis, and that's what I plan on doing.  This week being the exception as it's my first week and 10% of nothing is nothing ðŸ˜‰.</p>
