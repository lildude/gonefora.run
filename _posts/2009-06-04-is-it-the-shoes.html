<p>Same runner, same day, with no instruction given in between videos.</p>
<p>Whilst this lady's barefoot form isn't brilliant in the first place (<a href="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/watch?v=zbgSEG_Yx2k">better example of good barefoot form</a>), it's very clear what a difference wearing shoes makes and it certainly helps to explain (not the same cause though as I definitely strike forefoot in shoes too) the <a href="/no-more-shoes">niggles I encountered</a> following wearing shoes for one run. </p>
