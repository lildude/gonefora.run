I suffered a sandal malfunction 8k's into this morning's run and I had to run the last 2k's home barefoot- how terrible, I know ðŸ˜‰.

I'm a bit annoyed as this run took me over 2000k in this pair and the soles are still as good as new and not showing any signs of wear. I guess I'll have to improvise a fix or ship in a new pair of straps all the way from the US. ðŸ˜¢
