<p>Last week I reached my target of 2000km of running for the year.  I plucked the figure out of the air at the beginning of the year knowing I'd get it, but I didn't think I'd get it this soon.  I think at this rate I might get close to about 2800km for the year, which is pretty impressive considering I only ran 1563km last year.  I also ticked off 1000km on my bike too, but that's mostly commuting.</p>
