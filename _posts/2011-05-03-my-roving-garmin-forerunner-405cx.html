<p>In an attempt to deliberately drain the battery in my Garmin Forerunner 405CX to get it to correctly reflect it's battery usage (I'm sure this is a firmware bug, but Garmin don't seem to be doing anything about it), last night I set the backlight timeout to "never", enabled the backlight, enabled the GPS, started the timer and place the watch on my desk.</p>
<p>Today I imported the data (cos I'm curious) and check out where my watch went when I wasn't watching...</p>

<p>It managed to rack up 1.7km which is pretty impressive considering the window was closed too ðŸ˜‰</p>
