<p>Quite a long and quite interesting <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-240-400--13691-1-1X2X3X4X5X6X7X8-9,00.html" target="_blank">analysis</a> on the growing use of minimalist running shoes from Runner's World. There isn't much new in here for anyone keeping up with the recent studies and minimalist shoe world, but it's good to see Runner's World finally acknowledging that big cushiony shoes are not the best thing.  Me thinks RW may have some advertising deals in the pipeline - why else would they start promoting something they always shunned?</p>
