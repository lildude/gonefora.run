<p>Are we hardwired to run efficiently, and NOT in the way the shoe companies think we should?  I think these two videos prove we may well be.</p>
<p>First off, the kids.  They haven't had a chance to be manipulated by fancy running shoes and as we can see from this video, POSE/Chi/Evolution running are all really stating what we already know before we even know we know it...</p>

<p>Now for something mentioned in Christopher McDougall's book "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Born-Run-ultra-running-super-athlete-tribe/dp/1861978235/?tag=costest-21">Born to Run</a>" (<a href="/book-born-to-run-by-christopher-mcdougall">my review</a>) ... the ability of humans to literally run their prey to death in the "persistence hunt".</p>

<p>Whilst these aren't barefoot specific, the mechanics enforced by barefoot/minimalist running are re-enforced in these videos.</p>
