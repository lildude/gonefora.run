Once again I find myself in San Francisco for work and I realised the American distrust for free extends to running too.

On Sunday morning I went for my last long run before the London Marathon and ran the length of the Embarcadero. I like the route as it's nice and flat, except for the big hill round Fort Mason, and has great views of the bridge and Alcatraz. It's also a great sunny route so I can top-up on my vitamin D at the same time. Anyway, my run was cut short because of an event starting and finishing at Crissy Field, the Presidio 10 Mile/10KM/5KM.  I knew this event was on but chose not to enter any of them as a) I didn't want to tempt fate by racing so close to London, b) I had other plans for a long run already scheduled and c) I objected to paying what I consider an exorbitant entry fee. And it's this last point that I want to come back to.

The 5K race had [727 finishers](http://results.chronotrack.com/event/results/event/event-13531?lc=en), all of whom paid between $35 and $45 to run those 5 kilometers. $35??!! And all they got for their money and time was a T-shirt.  Saturday morning, [Crissy Field parkrun](http://www.parkrun.us/crissyfield/), which takes place in the exact same place, which costs absolutely NOTHING had 19 finishers.

What's the affliction with free?  parkrun is not an inferior product.  Yes, you don't get a T-shirt and medal after each run, but you do after [50, 100, 250 etc](http://www.parkrun.com/about/our-clubs/) but that's not the point. It's about getting out and having fun and keeping healthy all for the handsome price of nothing, zip, nada, not a penny. And best of all, officially timed results each and every time.
