<p>My new <a href="/challenge-run-at-least-3km-everyday-for-30-days" target="_blank">30 day challenge</a> has already helped my running... it's given me the motivation to actually starting doing long runs on the weekends again.  Today I headed out for my first weekend long run in a very very long time and I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I didn't push things too hard and just aimed for 15km or 75mins, whichever came first, over as much offroad terrain as I could (I wore the Merrell Trail Gloves).  In the end it was the 15km mark that came first, but only by about 2 mins.  I kept things at a pretty consistent pace (around 4:47/km) and it was only the last 4 up hill kilometers that I really slowed down.</p>
<p>It was really enjoyable and great to be back out on the roads early on a Sunday morning when no one is around, though that said I was quite surprised at the number of families already taking a stroll around the local lakes and ponds.</p>
<p>I'll definitely be looking forward to next weekend's long run.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and this long run completes what has ended up being a bumper week in the mileage front: 58km in total this week which is pretty high considering I also had a 10k race on Wednesday.  Today's run also ticks off one of my goals - a 15km long run.  Lets see if this can become a habit.</p>
