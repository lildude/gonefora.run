<p>There's a great article on the Daily Mail site about running barefoot: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1170253/The-painful-truth-trainers-Are-expensive-running-shoes-waste-money.html">The painful truth about trainers: Are running shoes a waste of money?</a>.  Well worth a read and certainly substantiates my decision to move away from expensive "useless" shoes to running barefoot.</p>
