I've been struggling with tender achilles and heels ever since Comrades and really haven't managed to get back into full swing running as a result. That is until I discovered this exercise...

It's inspired by this exercise from Kelly Starrett...

The change on my achilles and heels has been phenomenal and instantaneous. I've literally gone from having that niggling feeling to no symptoms at all after a few seconds on each calf.

I had incredibly tight calves in my build up to Comrades this year and I think this exercise my be just what I need to keep them nice and "loose".
