<p>I can't believe I missed this.  Christopher McDougall (author of <a href="/book-born-to-run-by-christopher-mcdougall" target="_blank">Born to Run</a>) has a good discussion on the <a href="http://www.chrismcdougall.com/barefoot.html" target="_blank">barefoot running debate</a> that is worth a read.  Ultimately, I think it all comes down to a single quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>But ultimately, the debate isn't about Bare Soles vs. Shoes. It's about learning to run gently. Master that, and you can wear — or not wear — anything you please.<br />
&mdash; <a href="http://www.chrismcdougall.com/barefoot.html" target="_blank">Christopher McDougall</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This is essentially what I've been telling everyone who asks me why I run barefoot.</p>
