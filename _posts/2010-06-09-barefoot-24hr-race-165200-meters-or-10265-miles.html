<p>Some say barefoot runners are crazy and I tend to joke about it too and talk people round to seeing my point of view, but Todd Ragsdale takes the biscuit.  He's definitely mad: <a href="http://therunningbarefoot.com/?p=5550">102.65 miles around a 400 meter track for a new world record</a>.  You can see a <a href="http://www.ktvl.com/video/?videoId=90270344001&lineupId=1155263524">news report from a local TV station</a> too (how old is the article's reporter?  15? I feel so old).  </p>
