Looky what my lovely wife arranged for us to attend on Monday night.  I didn't even know this was going on let alone have any clue about the surprise.  I've heard and read a lot about the day Sir Roger Bannister ran the first sub-4 minute mile before and it was really nice to hear him tell it in his own words.  It was also really nice to see he's still very enthusiastic about it and running in his old age.
