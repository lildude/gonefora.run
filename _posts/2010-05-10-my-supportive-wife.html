<p>Some of my friends and family think I'm a little bonkers when they hear I've taken up running again, but this time completely barefoot.  I'm sure most of them give it a fleeting thought whilst we're discussing it and then shrug it off with the thought "daft fool".  Well, not my wife.  Whilst she isn't into running and isn't likely to pick it up any time soon, she is supportive and she made me smile yesterday. Whilst driving home from my sister-in-law's, we passed a runner and out of the blue my wife nodded in his direction and said "<em>Lose the shoes you woofta</em>". </p>
