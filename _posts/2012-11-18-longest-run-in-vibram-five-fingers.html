<p>This morning I headed out for my longest ever training run which also happened to be my longest ever run in Vibram Five Fingers - today I ran in the <a href="/vibram-five-finger-seeya">Seeyas</a>.</p>
<p>I went out with the intention of running for 3 hours.  I worked out I'd probably cover about 33-35km in that time.  I ended up covering just over 35km in 2 hours and 57 minutes - I'd already tacked on a run round the block as I got back home way quicker than I anticipated, so didn't push things to get the final 3 minutes.</p>
<p>It was a lovely run.  Not a cloud in the sky and thankfully very little traffic on the country roads I was running on.  One thing is for sure: I definitely over dressed for this run.  It was 2C when I left, so I dressed for it, only to find that the sun was very warming and I soon warmed up meaning I ended up running most of my run with the outer jacket wrapped round my waist.</p>
<p>Today's run also took this week's "kilometer-age" over 100km.  My 5th 100km week of the year, and probably my last for the year.  I however plan to get in a lot more of these big weeks next year - I'm thinking at least one a month.  We'll see how it goes.</p>
<p>Anyway, the sun is still shining, I have tired legs, so I think I'll spend the rest of the day on my bum drinking beer (after we've popped to Sainsbury's for a little top-up grocery shop). Wonder if I can convince the Mrs to take me to the pub whilst we're out ðŸ˜‰</p>
