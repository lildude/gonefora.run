<p>I just received the latest newsletter from David Lloyd and noticed they're now promoting a new kind of group exercise..</p>
<blockquote cite="http://news.davidlloydleisure.co.uk/interface/external_view_email.php?U816216838635471915535295"><p>Bokwa® is a new and completely different approach to group exercise that is rapidly spreading across the globe.</p>
<p>Bokwa® participants draw letters and numbers with their feet while performing an energizing and addictive cardio workout routine. Moving together to today's most popular music, participants off all ages draw the Bokwa® L, 3, J, K and dozens of other steps.<br />

<p>You've got to be kidding?! Someone has come up with a fancy name for writing letters of the alphabet and numbers with your feet whilst listening to music and this is "rapidly spreading across the globe"?!   Spreading across the globe with whom? OAPs and toddlers?</p>
<p>I'm obviously missing something as this seems to be another exercise gimmick to me.  I definitely won't be attending any of these classes.</p>
