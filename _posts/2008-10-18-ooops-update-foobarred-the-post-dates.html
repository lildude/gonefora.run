<p>Ooops.  I've just updated the backend Habari code that runs <a href="http://barefootrunner.co.uk">barefootrunner.co.uk</a> and in the process seem to have broken the date as displayed for each post.  This appears to be purely cosmetic, so it's probably something in the theme code, as the database shows the correct date.</p>
<p>I'll try and resolve this as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Well that was simpler than expected.  All fixed now.</p>
