<p>I've put together a table of <a href="/goals">goals</a> I plan to achieve in my quest to be a barefoot runner. After all, everyone accomplishes more if they've actually got something to strive for. </p>
<p>I've started off really simple with some easily attainable goals so I don't get demotivated too easily.</p>
<p>I will however be adding to the list of goals as I progress to keep myself motivated, or if I start knocking them off too quickly.</p>
