<p>Home and showered after a great Maidenhead 10 Mile race. It was lovely and dry and sunny, though still cold. Good watch time too: 1:01:18. Not bad considering the stage I'm at in my marathon training. Next week will be my last 100k+ week before my marathon.  Think I may need to start considering an alternate shoe to race in too... the Vibram Seeyas keep giving me blisters between my some of my toes, but not all the time.  I'm reluctant to change shoes as I love running in the Seeyas.  Might tape my toes for my marathon and then keep my eyes peeled for something just a light and minimal, but without the toe pockets.</p>
