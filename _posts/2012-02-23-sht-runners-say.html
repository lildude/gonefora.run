<p>Runners are strange creatures.  We get up at insane hours of the morning to run insane distances on an almost daily basis.  Along with this comes all the banter about these shoes, that injury, and the next best running gadget or race you must run.  </p>
<p>Recently talk has turned to barefoot and minimalist running and along with it a whole new topic of discussion for those long Sunday runs. As with anything new or different, you always get the "experts" and those who get a bit over enthusiastic and this is what Steven Sashen of <a href="http://www.invisibleshoe.com/" target="_blank">Invisible Shoes</a> has capitalised on for this first video, "Sh*t Barefoot Runners Say"...</p>

<p>Of course, there's also the flip side, which Steven has just captured in his sequel... "Sh*t Runners Say to Barefoot Runners"...</p>

<p>I don't think I've said any of the things in the first, but I've definitely been the recipient of many of the comments in the second.</p>
