Woohoo!! ðŸŽ‰ My name got drawn for next yearâ€™s Berlin marathon. I can redeem myself for my one and only other performance in [2016](https://gonefora.run/berlin-marathon-2016). Iâ€™ve also got confirmation my 2020 London championship entry will be rolled over to 2023â€”Iâ€™ll be doing the general start as Iâ€™ve not got a qualifying time and I canâ€™t use my runs from this year for a Good For Age entry as Chicago was after the qualifying period.
