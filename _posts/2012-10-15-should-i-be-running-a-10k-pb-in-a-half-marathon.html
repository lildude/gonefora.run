<p>Yesterday I ran the Oxford Half-marathon and set a new all-time personal best (PB) for the half-marathon (more details coming in a later post) and I was just in the process of reviewing my <a href="//connect.garmin.com/activity/233229988" target="_blank">watch data</a> when I noticed the following:</p>
<figure class="center"><img alt="10k PB in a Half-marathon" src="/img/10k_pb_in_21k.png" width="260" height="160" /><br />
<figcaption>I went through the 10k mark 1 second ahead of my all-time 10k PB time</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That folks is an all time PB for 10km for me, by one second, and it has occurred in the middle of a half-marathon.  Now I admit I started yesterday's run a little fast, but I don't think I did it that fast.  I guess I did.</p>
<p>It certainly means a sub-37 min 10km race is definitely on the cards next year.  Who knows, maybe I can dip below 36 mins. Now that would be amazing.</p>
