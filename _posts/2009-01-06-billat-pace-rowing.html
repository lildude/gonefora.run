<p>I know what you're thinking: this blog is about running barefoot, why on earth am I mentioning rowing?  Well, simple really: as you'll recall from my previous post, I'm not running at the moment and am using rowing to keep fit instead.</p>
<p>This month's  UK edition of Runner's World (January '09) has an article on a method of training devised by Veronique Billat.  The basic principle is you determine your vVO<small>2</small> max and then train at that level using varying intervals.  I'm a big fan of intervals (I know, I'm insane) and was quite eager to try this out however due to my self-imposed running "embargo", this is currently off the cards.</p>
<p>Fear not, I turned to my good friend - t'Internet - to see if I could find details on using this approach for rowing.  Well, the best source of info I could find was <a href="http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/0350.htm">this one</a> which provides quite generic instructions, but doesn't explicitly mention rowing, and <a href="http://www.brianmac.co.uk/vvo2max.htm">here</a> which provides a bit more info and a handy calculator.  As the instructions are quite generic, I couldn't see any reason why it shouldn't be possible.</p>
<p>So I've decided to see if I could apply the principles to rowing.  </p>
<p><!--more-->Yesterday I did about 10 mins of gentle rowing and then blasted my way through 6 mins of hard fast rowing to see how far I could get in that time - 1598m.  </p>
<p>Now to calculate my vVO<small>2</small> max:</p>
<pre>
   Distance / seconds 
=  1598 / 360
=  4.44 metres / second
</pre>
<p>This isn't particularly useful when it comes to rowing as the rowing machines I have access to show pace in time per 500m, so  converting this to time per 500m should make things easier...</p>
<pre>
  6/((Distance/1000m)*2)
= 1:53 mins / 500m
</pre>
<p>So in order to row at my vVO<small>2</small> max pace, I need to be rowing at a pace of 1min 53 secs per 500m.</p>
<p>My next challenge was to determine my tvVO<small>2</small> max.  </p>
<p>With my vVO<small>2</small> max pace, I set to determining my tvVO<small>2</small> max this morning. I should probably have left it a couple more days, but I was too anxious to get going.  My tvVO<small>2</small> max came in at 1890m.</p>
<p>Oh yes, a few technical bits that are worth considering in the context of this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>all rowing is done with a drag setting of about 130</li>
<li>I was very honest with myself when calculating my vVO<small>2</small> and tvVO<small>2</small> settings:
<ul>
<li>vVO<small>2</small>: I used the timer to ensure I could get an accurate distance for 6 mins.</li>
<li>tvVO<small>2</small>: I allowed for a fluctuation of 3 seconds per 500m in either direction on my vVO<small>2</small> pace as keeping a consistent pace is a bit hard.  I took my distance reading as soon as I hit 3 consecutive strokes that were 3 or more seconds above my vVO<small>2</small> pace.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I have my figures, I can go about training using Billat pace on the rower.  I'll keep you updated as I progress.</p>
