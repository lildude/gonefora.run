<p>Just a short update to say I had a glorious 15 minute drills/run session in my Vibrams on Monday and it felt FANTASTIC.  Sadly my feet were quite tired the next morning, so I've not been out in them again since.  I think I'll stick with once a week in the Vibrams until such time as I'm getting in some good mileage with shoes on, and then I'll start weaning myself off the shoes and back into the Vibrams.</p>
