<p>Well, after a slightly extended <a href="http://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals-on-hold-for-the-moment">enforced layoff</a> (some how I managed to hurt my lower back 3 weeks ago), I'm now back on my feet and boy does it feel good.  Only a short 10 minute stint today in shoes, but I'm feeling good and my feet are feeling good.  Hopefully it'll be plain sailing from now on.</p>
<p>My plan for this week is to give my feet a chance to adjust to the joys of running again, in shoes, and get back into the Vibrams next week.</p>
