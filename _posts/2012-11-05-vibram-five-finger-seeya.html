<p>The posty came to see me again today to drop off my newest order...</p>

<p>Let me hear you all say "Ooooooo".  </p>
<p>These will now be my primary road shoe, though I think I might rotate them with the <a href="/vibram-five-fingers-spyridon">Spyridons</a>. Now I can finally retire my Vibram Five Finger Bikilas and my Merrell Trail Gloves, both of which you can see day through the soles.  My colleague who sits next to me will also be pleased with this new arrival - the Bikilas are starting to rot they smell so bad at times ðŸ™‚</p>
