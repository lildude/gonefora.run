<p>So you've made the jump from running in shoes to running barefoot, but you just can't convince the wife and kids (the older ones) to embrace your passion.  Well how about taking them on a barefoot holiday.  Yes, a barefoot holiday.</p>
<p>I've just discovered there are these really cool <a href="http://www.barfusspark.info/en/park.htm" target="_blank">barefoot parks</a> all over Europe (predominantly in German and Austria) that are open to the public and offer you the opportunity to go for barefoot walks. These parks actually encouraged you to take off your shoes and get one with nature (you'll have to go elsewhere if you want to really get one with nature ðŸ˜‰ ) and feel the earth below your feet, feel the cold water between your toes and the pebbles under your feet as you walk through streams and rivers.  Some even offer playground areas specially designed for being bare foot.</p>
<p>What a great idea, and what a great way to get the whole family involved in your new found passion for going barefoot.  Who knows, maybe after one of these holidays your wife or one of your kids will want to join you on one of your barefoot runs, barefoot.</p>
