Today is Sunday and that means one thing: it's long run day, and there's no way I was going to miss out on it with all these great Colorado mountains within spitting distance.  As luck would have it, I happened to be staying no too far from [America‚Äôs Toughest Trail: The Manitou Incline](http://running.competitor.com/2016/06/trail-running/americas-toughest-trail-the-manitou-incline_152535).  To quote the article...

> When it comes to describing the Manitou Incline, there‚Äôs no mincing words. It‚Äôs relentlessly steep and a ferocious challenge for anyone who tries to hike or run it.
>
>Situated near the base of Pikes Peak in Manitou Springs, Colo., the Manitou Incline rises more than 2,000 vertical feet in less than a mile. It‚Äôs unyieldingly steep‚Äî68 percent in some places‚Äîbut that‚Äôs why runners and hikers from near and far have been taking the challenge for years.

... and there's no way I was going to miss out on this one. I've brought up the idea of running this in the work running repo and there seems to be quite a bit of enthusiasm for it, but I wanted to make sure I got to do it at least once, just in case the üçª, :wine_glass: and üç∏ took over and persuaded peeps against it, so I did that this morning.

I ran the 14k from The Broadmoor hotel to the base of the incline and then made my way up the incline.  I originally thought I'd be able to run/power walk up the incline.  Oh I was sooooo wrong. This incline gets very steep very quickly and coupled with the altitude, I soon found just walking was tough and had to pause many times. It took me [40:36 from first to last step](https://www.strava.com/activities/644200334/segments/15749715025).

Once at the top, I paused for a while to recover, snap a photo or two and then headed back down using the zig-zaggy Barr trail, which was way less challenging and more scenic.

By the time I got to the bottom I was really really thirsty. I'd been sweating like a pig and I didn't take any water with me.  I bought a bottle of water from the shoppe at the base, had a peek at the cog railway station and train and then headed back to the hotel.

The run back to the hotel was a lot tougher than going out. The incline took a heck of a lot out of me and I was definitely broaching on dehydration. I ended up walking quite a few of the hills on the way back and stopped for a drink from the Fountain Creek and the stand-pipe at the Bear Creek Dog Park - you can trust humans to have free drinking water for dogs more readily available than drinking water for humans.

All in all I was out for just over 4 hours, ran just short of 34k and climbed over 1050m in the glorious sunshine, and got this really cool shark-fin elevation profile:

This was a fantastic run and I'm so glad I've done the incline. You can check it out on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/644200334) too.
