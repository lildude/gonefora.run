I've just finished another longest run since the Valencia Marathon and closed off my biggest month since July last year. It was only 257km which is a long way off the 487km I did in July, but it's significantly more than I've run since. I think I might finally be back into running. ðŸŽ‰ Gonna back off next week, perform a critical power test, and then push for a few 100km weeks in the second half of June.
