<p>Woohoo!!! My postal entry into the <a href="http://www.abingdonmarathon.org.uk/" target="_blank">Abingdon Marathon</a> on 20 Oct 2013 has been accepted. I am now running one of the fastest marathons in the UK.  I'm very chuffed as this is a very popular marathon and the online entry has already closed.  I can now do all four of the races for the <a href="http://www.berkshireathletics.org.uk/rr.htm" target="_blank">Berkshire Champs</a>.  I don't expect to win the Berkshire Champs, but running all four races will certainly see me fair quite well.</p>
