<p>18 successive days of running, averaging over 100km a week, really works for me. Just ran the toughish Yateley 10k, with a rare negative split and set a new PB of 36:34 chip time and finished 12th. Chuffed to bits. If I can keep this up I think I'll get a PB for both my half and full marathons this season.</p>
