<p>Today I ventured out for my very first "very cold barefoot run".  It's been a bit late coming as last week saw large parts of the UK covered in snow, and if your area wasn't covered in snow, it was freeeeeeeezing.  My area was a bit of both - we had a light dusting of snow on two days and then sub-zero temperatures for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>I've been doing a fair bit of reading on cold weather barefoot running and I've drawn a line in the sand (or should that be snow) as to when I will and will not head out for a run barefoot.  That line is 0°C.  This is technically freezing point or water at sea-level and if the air is this cold, there's a very good chance the ground and water on it will be too - probably colder once you add the salt and grit.</p>
<p>On Monday I went out in Vibrams as I had scheduled a fast tempo run along the Thames which would take in quite a long section of pavement that was quite heavily gritted.  It was also bordering 0°C so I didn't want to risk it.  Today it was definitely warmer, so I decided I'd brave the cold and I'm glad I did.  It wasn't anywhere near as bad as I thought it would be.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="http://therunningbarefoot.com/?p=7180" target="_blank">Owen McCall's very good tips</a>, I</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>over dressed</strong>: tights, long sleeve t-shirt, close fitting windbreaker, beanie and gloves</li>
<li><strong>warmed up inside</strong>: dynamic warm ups from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0451222326?ie=UTF8&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0451222326">Brain Training for Runners</a> with some kettlebell swings</li>
</ol>
<p>... and then headed out a little on the sweaty side.  Normally I'd strip off at this point but I held back and stayed wrapped up for my entire run.  My body and feet soon cooled down a bit in the 1 mile to the field in which I did my 6x600m intervals at 3k pace.  The cool down wasn't dramatic and I soon found my feet warmed up again too.  </p>
<p>The coldest part of the run was running on grassy sections no one else had passed over that day.  The grass was still a little dewy and cold, but thankfully not frozen.</p>
<p>Bar the very strange looks I got from people I passed, my first very cold barefoot run turned out to be a great success and provided the temperature is above 0°C on a given day and I'm not running through heavily gritted areas, I'll continue to do my runs barefoot this winter.</p>
