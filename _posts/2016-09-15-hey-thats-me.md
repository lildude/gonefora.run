Unbeknownst to me, I made an [appearance](https://www.instagram.com/p/BI2nr7mD8-_/) on the [London Marathon Instagram feed](https://www.instagram.com/londonmarathon/) about five weeks ago:

This is from the London Marathon in 2015. I don't recall having the energy to do this - I crashed badly after going out waaaay too fast - let alone actually doing it. But as they say, a picture is worth a thousand words, and it's a fantastic picture too.
