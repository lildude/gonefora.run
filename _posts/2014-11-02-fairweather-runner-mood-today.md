It's tipping it down outside and I'm in a fairweather runner mood, so I'll be replacing my long run with [watching](http://7online.com/nycmarathon/) the New York City marathon.

**Update:** The rain has stopped and the radar shows no more rain for the next few hours so I'm hitting the road after all. BIAB.
