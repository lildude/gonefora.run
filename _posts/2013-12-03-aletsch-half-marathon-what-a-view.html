<p>Now how's this for a view in a half-marathon race...</p>
<figure class="center"><img alt="Aletsch Half-marathon view" src="/assets/aletsch-half-marathon.jpg" width="1280" height="738" /><figcaption>What a view!!! (Image borrowed from the backdrop on the Aletsch half-marathon website.)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is what runners get to see when running the <a href="http://www.aletsch-halbmarathon.ch/en/index.php" target="_blank">Aletsch Half-marathon</a>.  It's a nice flat race with <em>only</em> around 1050m of elevation change ;-).</p>
<p>I've added this one to my bucket list. Sadly, I can't do it this year as I've already chosen to <a href="http://www.whitestarrunning.co.uk/eventPage.php?eventId=1" target="_blank">run past a chalk giant with a huge penis in the Dorset hills</a> that weekend, but maybe next year.</p>
<p>Thanks to my colleague, Doug, for pointing this race out to me.</p>
