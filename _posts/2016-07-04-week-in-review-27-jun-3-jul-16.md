Nothing much to report on this week. I landed back in Blighty nice and early on Monday morning, and whilst sooo tempted to go straight to sleep, I managed to keep myself awake with a bit of work and then a nice easy run.

The rest of the week has been about getting my mileage back up with a lot of longish easy runs. If there's anything to report, it's that I drank waaaay too much beer towards the end of the week ðŸ˜Š which only seemed to really affect the end of my long run on Sunday.

Please to drink a lot less next week as the mileage is taking another step up.
