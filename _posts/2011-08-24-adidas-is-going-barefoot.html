<p>This is quite interesting... Adidas appear to be taking a brave and bold step into the world of "barefoot shoes" (what a silly expression) with their own Vibram Five Finger-a-likees, the Adidas Adipure:</p>

<p>As I see it, this is an interesting development.  First, Adidas appears to be making a much bigger statement about the potential impact of minimalist shoes on their market than any of the other major brands have dared do - Nike Frees are NOT minimalist or "like barefoot".  I don't care what Nike say.  Secondly, <a href="http://birthdayshoes.com/vibram-fivefingers-sues-fila-skele-toes-for-patent-infringement" target="_blank">Vibrams are currently suing Fila for patent infringement</a>.  Has Adidas licensed these patents from Vibram or are they going in guns blazing and hoping to dig themselves out when the pooh when it hits the fan?</p>
<p>I've already got 3 pairs of Vibram Five Fingers (VFF) and really enjoy running in them.  I also quite like the look of these new Adidas Adipures and if the planned price is anything to go by, they'll be offering a good alternative to VFFs at a comparable price.  The pictures and the Gizmodo review however concern me a bit: they seem to indicate a fair bit of cushioning so I'd like to try these on before coughing up my cash.</p>
