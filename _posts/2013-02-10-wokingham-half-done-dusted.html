<p>I'm home, dry and warm and on my second beer. Great run today, though very much on the wetter and colder side of things for my liking. Had things been dry and had it not been the start of the season, this is definitely a PB course. Maybe next year. </p>
<p>Got a bloody great big blister on one of my toes as a reward for my 2nd faster half-marathon. Vibrams at speed in the wet result in some beautiful blisters.</p>
<p>Preliminary results give me a chip time to 1:22:24 and I finished in 133rd position.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and I entered the <a href="http://www.berkshireathletics.org.uk/rr.htm" target="_blank">Berkshire Champs for 2013</a>, just to see how I do. 1 done, 3 more to go, assuming I actually get into the Abingdon Marathon.  Not holding my breath as that is a popular fast race.</p>
