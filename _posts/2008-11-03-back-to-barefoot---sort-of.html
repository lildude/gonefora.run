<p>Well, last week was another low mileage week with only 2 sessions of 6mins @ 2% @ 6mph on the treadmill and in shoes as I said they would be.</p>
<p>The runs were good and my right foot felt good without any niggles, so I think I'll be back to barefoot this week.  </p>
<p>Well, sort of.  I'm getting fed up of running on a treadmill already and am itching to get outside and run a bit further, however it's turned a tad chilly and I don't think my feet are tough enough yet to cope with the rough tarmac AND the cold and wet, so this week I'm venturing outside in my <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/vibram-five-fingers/">Vibrams</a> - it's just as good as barefoot.</p>
<p>I think I'll run in my Vibrams until the spring.</p>
