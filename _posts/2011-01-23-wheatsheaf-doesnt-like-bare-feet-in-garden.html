<p>Sign spotted at the foot of the steps into the Wheatsheaf Pub last summer when my wife and I went for a walk around Virginia Water (I've only just found it after trawling through all my photos I've taken but not done anything with)...</p>

<p>I can understand the need for tops at all times (some people don't like looking at boobies) and shoes in the pub, but what's so wrong with toasting my piggies in the garden?  I promptly ignored the sign and kicked off my Vibrams (I put them back on when I went inside) and no one commented or made a complaint.  Someone may have tutted, but I'm immune to the English tut :-D</p>
