<p>I forgot to provide and update for last week's runs: just two runs this time (as I couldn't be bothered on Friday ðŸ˜‰ ), both of 5min 30 sec @ 2% gradient @ 6mph giving a distance of about 0.54 miles per run, and both on the treadmill in the gym.</p>
<p>My only issue is the 2nd metatarsal on my right foot was a bit tender after the second run.  I think I may be aggravating an injury I imposed on myself several months ago when I got my Vibrams and tried to run the distances I ran in shoes.</p>
<p>I think I'll stick to bumping the time on my runs, but I'll run in shoes this week.</p>
