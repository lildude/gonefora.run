<p>I know this is a bit short notice, but I've been a tad on the excessively busy side of things are work and really haven't wanted to touch a computer when I got home.</p>
<p>If you're interested in taking the plunge into barefoot running, but want to be sure you're doing it right or with a bit of guidance, why not take advantage of the Barefoot Experience Workshops Terra Plana are hosting next week...</p>
<p><!--more--><br />
<blockquote>Learn the skill of barefoot walking and running at 'The Barefoot Experience' Terra Plana, 36 Kings Road, London SW3.
<p>Spearheaded by new research and the international bestseller 'Born to Run' the barefoot movement is gathering pace. London’s first 'Barefoot Experience' is dedicated to helping people rediscover natural movement, and better health, from the feet up.</p>
<p>In January 2010 Professor Dan Lieberman of Harvard University released his seminal research on the benefits of barefoot and the dangers of normal padded running shoes (Nature Magazine, 'Tread Softly') adding to a number of other scientific studies showing how underfoot shoe technologies are doing more harm than good. </p>
<p>Terra Plana are creators of Vivobarefoot, the original barefoot shoe, with a patented ultra thin puncture resistant sole that gives all the benefits of being barefoot with protection. </p>
<p>Now Terra Plana are proud to announce their first public workshops, to learn the key to injury free barefoot running &amp; walking. These sessions are available on a first come, first served basis and are <strong>free</strong> of charge.</p>
<p>Classes last for 1.5 hours, 6 places are available at each session; participants will be filmed on the instore treadmill (allowing each person to see improvements in technique).</p>
<p>Walking classes are available on Monday August 16th &amp; Wednesday August 18th. Running classes are available on Wednesday August 25th &amp; Saturday August 28th.</p>
<p>Classes will run at the following times on each day:                                                         </p>
<p>10 – 11.30am, 11.30 – 1.00pm, 2 – 3.30pm, 3.30 – 5.00pm, 5.00 – 6.30pm.              </p>
<p>Classes will be conducted by Tony Riddle. Tony is a highly respected international running coach and numbers premier league footballers amongst his clients. Tony was trained by and works closely with, leading barefoot running expert, Lee Saxby; he is a qualified POSE level 2 instructor.                                                              </p>
<p>Come and enjoy the 'Barefoot Experience', kick off your shoes, release your feet, stimulate your soles and rediscover the joy of natural movement… </p>
<p>Where: 36 Kings Road, London SW3 / nearest tube: Sloane Square</p>
<p>For bookings please call: 0207 581 5764. Limited places available.</p>
<p>I hope you didn't miss the word <strong>FREE</strong> in there.  So if you're in or around London next week, want some guidance on barefoot running or walking, then give Terra Plana bell and get yourself booked in a slot.</p>
<p>Sadly, I'm still nurturing my foot back to full recovery after <a href="/tofp-probably-stress-fracture" target="_blank">hurting</a> it (we're nearly there - more news coming soon) so I won't be taking advantage of this offering  :-( .</p>
<p>I'm not in the least bit happy with having to turn this, and another session with Lee Saxby down, but I'd rather be 100% fully recovered before hitting the tarmac than rush things just to get a session with one of the top barefoot experts in the UK.  Maybe next time, if there is one.</p>
