Wondering why your first few runs of the year seemed to follow the right track but show shifted over on Strava etc? You’ve got a device with a Sony GPS chip and an old/wrong GPS data file possibly caused by 2020 having 53 weeks 🤦‍♂️ <https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/01/gps-accuracy-impacting-devices.html>
