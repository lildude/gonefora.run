<p>I don't know what it is, maybe it's the training, maybe it's the low-carb diet, maybe it's the water or even the air but whatever it is it's doing wonders for my running and it's getting better and better as the year progresses.  The past few days I've felt significantly lighter and quicker on my feet and it carried through to this <a href="http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/results/weeklyresults?runSeqNumber=150" target="_blank">morning's parkrun</a>. Today I smashed my previous <a href="http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/results/weeklyresults?runSeqNumber=149" target="_blank">parkrun PB of 18:08</a> by a whopping 32 seconds to bring me in comfortably under 18 minutes...</p>

<p>Yes folks, that's 17:36.  Let me repeat: <strong>17:36!!!!</strong>. I think this has to be an all time personal best.  I can't remember ever running 5km this fast, and what's more I've done it off road on a grassy parkrun course, so who knows how much quicker I could be on a nice flat road 5k.  A little bit of me is disappointed: we're fast approaching the end of the season so I don't think I'll be able to see how this translates over a nice fast flat 10k.  Sub-37min maybe?  We'll have to see next year.</p>
<p>For this year, I've still got the <a href="http://www.purplepatchrunning.com/races/pharmalink-maidenhead-half-marathon" target="_blank">Maidenhead Half Marathon on 16 September</a> and as this is a fast flat 2-lapper in an area I'm very familiar with, today's 5k time could translate into an all-time half-marathon PB.  Can't wait.</p>
