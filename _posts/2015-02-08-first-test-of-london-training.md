The first test of my London Marathon training is today: the [Wokingham Half Marathon](http://www.wokinghamhalfmarathon.co.uk/). I'm not expecting to get under 80 mins, but it'll be interesting to see how close I get with a steady planned race.

**Update:** My training is definitely on track. Pretty chuffed with my 1:21:03 chip time. I think I might be able to dip under 80mins next month.
