<p>About two thirds of the way into my long run today I somehow managed to trip over something and severely stub my toes.  The result, some lovely blue/purple and tender toes...</p>

<p>I've got quite hideous looking feet to start off with - the stumpy looking middle toes has been that way since I hurt my foot last year - the added colouring doesn't make them any more appealing :-)</p>
<p>I don't think they're broken as I can move them without any pain.  I think they're just a little on the bruised side. Thankfully I was wearing my Merrells.  Who knows that my toes would look like had I not been.  Hopefully this won't affect my running too much.  I managed to finish my run this morning which entailed about another 7km after the stubbing without any discomfort.  We'll see how things are tomorrow.  Time to go ice them.</p>
