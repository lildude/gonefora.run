<p>Wow!! Apparently sugar has been <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news164164943.html" target="_blank">found</a> to decrease blood levels of testosterone by as much as 25% in perfectly healthy men. Could this explain why obese men get moobs? This is definitely one to consider if you're trying to lose weight, build muscle or have kids. I suspect this may be old new in the drug-taking-elite "athletes" world though.</p>
