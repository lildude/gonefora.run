![Row\'d Royalty 2021](/img/RR21.png){: .alignright} Throughout this whole ðŸ¦  pandemic last year and into this year I've avoided all virtual running events as they felt contrived, didn't have the excitement of a real event and it didn't feel right to pay for someone to send me a for challenging myself during training. I didn't even contemplate rowing challenges as "I'm not a rower". I was going to continue with this stance until [Rowâ€™d Royalty Starts Today!](https://www.concept2.com/news/rowd-royalty-starts-today) appeared in my blogroll this morning which caught my attention from the very first paragraph:

> The 2021 Rowâ€™d Royalty competition starts today; it is an annual event we love to sponsor due to its creativity, toughness and prizes. Any athlete, at any level of fitness, is welcome to join!

What caught my attention was:

1. it's a regular event and not something devised because of COVID,
2. it promises to be creative and challenging and last year's workouts confirm that,
3. it's for rowing - I've never entered a rowing competition,
4. some of the workouts have two ways to score points,
5. it has overall and category prizes!

I'm nowhere near an olympic or top club rower, but I think my times are pretty good for a 40+ year-old and I know my fitness has improved dramatically since I got my rower in July last year, so I thought, "What the heck, lets do it." and entered this morning.

Today's [workout](https://rowdroyalty.com/2021-workouts/): 

**WATER WATER EVERYWHERE**

4x 500m without any rests (2000m total)

Score A: 3rd 500m Interval time  
Score B: Time it took to row the entire 2000m

My results (a cropped version of the photo I submitted as proof):

![RR21.1: Water Water Everywhere](/img/RR21.1-proof.jpg){: .u-photo}

Score A: 1:38.4  
Score B: 6:51.9 which is a new 2k PB for me by 8s too.

Which at time of submission put me tie second overall ðŸŽ‰ - I don't expect to be there very long:

This was a tough workout though I didn't hit my max heart rate so either it's not as high as it was early last year or I had more in the tank and could have pushed harder ðŸ˜‰.

I'm looking forward to the next three weeks' workouts and will blog my progress over the next four weeks.
