<p><img class="alignleft" alt="Health Check" src="/img/healthcheck.jpg" />Monday night's episode of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/programmes/health_check.shtml">Health Check</a> (listen <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0073ryq">here</a>) on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/">BBC World Service</a> covers the topic of barefoot running with the reporter taking a quick spin barefoot round a track (and surprises herself) and then follows up with an interview with Daniel Lieberman in which he briefly covers what he discusses in his <a href="/my-thoughts-on-the-lieberman-paper">recent paper</a>.  What is quite impressive is just how much coverage barefoot running gets in one programme: over 11 minutes of a 28 minute programme. Impressive.</p>
<p><!--more-->The programme also discusses the human ability to run extreme distances and includes an interview with <del>a complete nutter</del> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/executives/timdavie.shtml">Tim Davie</a>, one of the BBC's directors, following his recent completion of the <a href="http://www.saharamarathon.co.uk/">Marathon Des Sables</a> and gets some scientific input from Daniel Lieberman.</p>
<p>Quite an interesting programme and it's great to hear barefoot running getting some exposure on a reputable service like the BBC World Service. Maybe we'll see a lot more barefoot or minimalist runners off the back of this, or even in this year's London Marathon on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>The programme is available for international listeners too.</p>
