People thought I was nuts running the Ragnar Relay and Bournemouth Marathon in Luna Sandals, but this guy takes the biscuit. Claus Rasmussen from Denmark has just [completed the Spartathlon in Luna Sandals](http://flatfoot.guru/spartathlon2014-race-report).

This is my kind of runner and I can almost guarantee, despite the single blister, his feet looked and felt way better than his fellow runners who wore shoes.

For those who like to listen to interviews instead, check out his interview on [Talk Ultra](http://iancorless.org/2014/10/16/episode-72-schlarb-campbell-rasmussen/).
