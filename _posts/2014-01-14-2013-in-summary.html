<p>I'm only a month and a half late with this, but as they say, "better late than never" ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>So how was 2013 for me in terms of running?  Absolutely bloody brilliant in the end.  </p>
<h2>Training</h2>
<p>I started the year off a little slowly.  The weather wasn't very good and I wasn't particularly motivated after working the Christmas period having gotten back from visiting family in South Africa.  What training I was doing was mostly the MAF approach with one session of Yasso 800s a week thrown in... the idea was to try and get a bit more speed in my legs in preparation for my first marathon in nearly 10 years.  This served me well, or so I thought. Blowing up spectacularly in the Milton Keynes marathon proved there was no way I was going to get under three hours on MAF alone... I needed more tough workouts that would teach me to run quicker and longer on tired legs.  So I did a bit of research and discovered the <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/race-training/marathoning-hansons-way?page=single" target="_blank">Hanson Marathon Method</a>. This struck a chord with me so I bought the book and I switched to the advanced programme of the Hanson Marathon Method and this proved to be a brilliant programme for me.  My mileage increased, my training more consistent and more importantly tougher and more specific to the demands of racing a sub-3 hour marathon. </p>
<p>All this marathon specific training also saw me tick off the most kilometres of running in a year ever of 3236km with 5 months topping 300km of which September was the highest at a whopping 383km.</p>
<h2>Races</h2>
<p>As you can expect all that training paid off and paid off brilliantly in all distances that I raced. I set new lifetime personal bests in all distances I raced and in some of them by a large margin over the year before.</p>
<p>Check out my <a href="/goals">Goals</a> page for my personal bests as they now stand.</p>
<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>I stuck with the paleo-lite/low-carb-high-fat (LCHF) diet as it is proving to work so well for my running and general health and energy levels.  I've not been 100% strict, but pretty consistent and I think its this consistency that has allowed me to adapt and take full advantage of all those fat calories.</p>
<h2>On to 2014</h2>
<p>So what's on the cards for 2014?  </p>
<ul>
<li>More training as I've entered three marathons spread across the year with the goal of dipping under 2:50 in the third Unfortunately, the training is on a bit of a go-slow as I write this as I've developed a suspected stress fracture in my right ankle which I'm putting down to literally hitting the track too hard: I think I went into track sessions with a little too much gusto.</li>
<li>More marathons: you've got to do them to become good at them.</li>
<li>More strength training.</li>
<li>My 50 parkruns T-shirt.</li>
<li>Stick with the LCHF diet and try and reduce the amount of beer I drink - this is my one "sin" under the LCHF diet.</li>
<li>Set new personal bests in all distances.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things started off so well this year before I hurt my ankle so here's to hoping it heals quickly and I can get back onto the road and back up to my desired and required training volume soon.</p>
