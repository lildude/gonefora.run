I was poking around the graphs and other things [Stravistix](http://thomaschampagne.github.io/stravistix/) - great extension by the way - adds to Strava today and I noticed this section on the right of my profile page:

![My Yearly Progressions](/img/year-progressions.png){:class="center"}

I clicked the graph icon and poked around the different graphs, which for the most parts confirm 2013 was a great year and 2016 is turning out to be a great year, but what I thought was most interesting was the severe jumps in elevation in July 2014 and this year:

![Elevation Jumps](/img/elevation-jumps.png){:class="center"}

Those are considerable and very obvious jumps.  So what can then be attributed to?  Work, well sort of.  They coincide with when our company summits occurred and the runs I did at each.  In 2014 we went to Whistler and I ran right to the top of Whistler and this year we went to Colorado Springs and I ran up "The Incline".

So if anyone tells you work doesn't play nice with your running, tell them they need to find a better job :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.
