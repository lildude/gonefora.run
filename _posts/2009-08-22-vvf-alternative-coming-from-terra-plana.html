<p>Check out what's been spotted on the <a href="http://twitpic.com/elqiu">interweb</a>...</p>
<p><img class="center" alt="New Terra Plana minimalist shoes" src="/img/NewTerraPlana.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p>A new pair of minimalist shoes to compete with Vibram Five Fingers.  Unfortunately, you can't see much from the pictures but they look to be quite low profile with traditional lacing.  One thing is for sure, the sole looks pretty cool. </p>
<p>Apparently these are due out in February (probably only in the US) with a remote possibility of a pre-Christmas release.</p>
<p>On the topic of Terra Plana shoes - has anyone had any experience with the Terra Plana Vivo Barefoot shoes?  I'm seriously considering getting a pair of these as an "everyday" pair of shoes to replace my Merrills or possible a more formal looking pair to wear for work.</p>
