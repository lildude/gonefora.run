<p>Look what I found on my doorstep this evening...</p>

<p>This is not the magazine I wanted to receive today.  I guess I'm going to have to go back to my original plan and actually run my nuts off and qualify to guarantee a place in the 2014 London Marathon.</p>
<p>Now to find another spring marathon to do instead. Hmmmm, Edinburgh? Paris? Milton Keynes?</p>
