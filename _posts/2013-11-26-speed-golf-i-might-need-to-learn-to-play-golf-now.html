<p>To me, golf is that activity that ruins a nice walk. Come to think of it, if I'm going to be walking on those lovely grassy fairways, I'd rather be running on them, barefoot.</p>
<p>Well, imagine my surprise when I discovered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_golf" target="_blank">speed golf</a>.  It's golf in which the objective is to finish as quickly as possible with the fewest number of strokes.  Each round takes about an hour to an hour-and-a-half instead of who knows how long.  You could probably cover 3-4 rounds of speed golf and get in a good long interval/fartlek session in the time it takes to do one round of normal golf.  Best thing of all, it's mostly on lovely plush grass so you could do it entirely barefoot too.</p>

<p>I might have a reason to learn to play golf now. Anyone up for a few rounds of barefoot speed golf on a fresh spring morning?</p>
