<p>I've just been in Orlando, Florida giving a presentation at <a href="http://collaborate11.org/" target="_blank">Collaborate 11</a> and just happened to come home with 4 news things in my suitcase... </p>
<p>A left and right one of these...</p>

<p>... and a left and right one of these (despite the picture, it comes with a right one too ðŸ˜‰ ) ...</p>
<figure class="center"><img alt="Merrell Trail Glove" src="/img/trailglove.jpeg" width="500" height="289" /><br />

<p>I also got a new pair of the Vibram Five Finger Classics I already have - grey and orange - as they were on special as the colour has apparently been discontinued.</p>
<p>Thanks to a favorable exchange rate, I've saved an absolute fortune. Now to give them each a good spin and then I'll write a review on each of them.  Both pairs of shoes have had a single 6km run and so far so good, but I want to give them a few more kilometers to get a good feel for them.  Watch this space.</p>
