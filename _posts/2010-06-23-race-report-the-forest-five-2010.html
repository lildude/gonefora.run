<p>Better late than never.  Last Wednesday saw me take on my first imperial distance race (we only do metric distances in South Africa): <a href="http://www.forestrunners.org.uk/events/forestfive" target="_blank">The Forest Five</a> (mile) at The Look Out in Bracknell and what a fantastic evening and offroad race it was.</p>
<p>Following <a href="/racing-offroad-research-it-first">the test run I did on the Monday</a>, I had intended on running in my huaraches, but then common sense prevailed and I opted to run in my Vibrams instead.  I decided not to run in the huaraches as I've not done much running in them yet and the last thing I wanted were blisters from the different style of footwear, especially likely as I'm not too sure I've got them properly adjusted yet.</p>
<p>My wife very generously offered to drive me to the race and we arrived with about half an hour to spare.  As I pre-registered online I already had my number so had plenty time to locate the race start - it's a little walk into the forest - and warm up.  It was a very pleasant evening, so getting warm wasn't a problem.  </p>
<p><!--more-->At just after 19:30 we were sent on our way by the most feeble sounding airhorn I've ever heard, or didn't. The air part was there, just the horn part made no sound at all: should have used a vuvuzela ðŸ™‚ .  As usual, I set off a little quick, but I managed to ensure it wasn't too quick and soon settled into a pace of about 4:20/km.  The route was slightly different from the one I found online and ran on the Monday, but only in the last half of the race in which they brought us back in a large arc which included a lot more little ups and downs than the original route.  This added a nice challenge and I suspect caught a few of those who've run the old route a little by surprise.  They did however warn us at the beginning that it was a slightly different route, though I couldn't hear why.  My watch also reported the route to be slightly shorter than 5 miles, but I think we can attribute this to the tree coverage over large parts of the route - the race organisers assured us the route is accurately measured.</p>
<p>As can be expected, my Vibrams lived up to expectations and protected my feet enough for me to maintain a nice fast pace without blocking too much feedback.  They also draw a lot of funny looks and even a couple of comments with one chap commenting on having read Born to Run, but not being brave enough to try barefoot or Vibrams.  I encouraged him to give barefoot a go and he then bid farewell and left me in hist dust ðŸ™‚ .</p>
<p>All in all, this was a very pleasant race.  It was a relatively small field, on a fabulous evening in a beautiful settings.  This is definitely a race I'll be doing again.  This part of Bracknell forest will also be getting a lot more visits from me too: it's a fantastic area to run.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and my official results:</p>
<p><strong>Time</strong>: 34:34<br />
<strong>Overall Position</strong>: 56 / 327<br />
<strong>Age Category Position</strong>: 28</p>
