<p>Headed out for my third <a href="http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/">Reading Parkrun</a> on my own this morning. My wife hasn't been sleeping too well, so I left her in bed this morning whilst I went off on another of my barefoot adventures.</p>

<p><!--more-->I had a relatively good run today.  I had intended on running at a consistent pace in the region of 3:48 to 3:54, but after a relatively quick first kilometre (I still don't go out gently enough), I started feeling a bit tired and settled in at a more relaxed pace.  Finished off with a fast last km with a near-sprint at the end.  Still managed a sub-20 so I'm happy.  This run also tipped me over the 400km of running this year.</p>
<p>I'm running the <a href="http://www.forestrunners.org.uk/events/forestfive">Forest Five</a> on Wednesday evening (probably in huaraches rather than barefoot as it's all offroad) and I'm on the early shift again next week, so I may not be up for another Parkrun next week, but I'll see how I feel.</p>
