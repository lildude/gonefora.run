<p>I'm a subscriber to Barefoot Ted's <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/huaraches">huaraches Google Group</a>, and the other day one of the members started a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/huaraches/browse_thread/thread/4a76247e814081ab/645ef8100fee23ae">thread</a> about funny comments and retorts which I thought I'd share in summary:</p>
<p><strong>OrionFyre: </strong></p>
<p>I got stopped by a cop who pulled up along side me to see if I was OK.<br />
"<em>why do you ask?</em>" I say.<br />
"<em>Because you're not wearing shoes...</em>" he replies<br />
I look down at my feet with a look of surprise. "<em>Oh shit! they must have fallen off.</em>"<br />
I stand upright and look back the way I had came covering my eyes from the suns glare. In the corner of my eye I see the cop turn around in the car and look back.<br />
"<em>dammit.</em>" I mumble aloud<br />
"<em>I knew I should have tied them tighter.</em>"</p>
<p><!--more--><strong>OrionFyre:</strong></p>
<p>Then a nice lady about my mother's age in a van was waiting to turn right when I was crossing She too asks if I was OK. "<em>yeah why?</em>" I ask.<br />
"<em>because you don't have no shoes.</em>"<br />
"<em>of course I don't</em>"<br />
"<em>why not?</em>"<br />
"<em>because I traded them for this jacket.</em>"<br />
"<em>why would you do that?</em>"<br />
"<em>ummm because it's going to be winter soon and I don't want to get cold...</em>"</p>
<p><strong>OrionFyre:</strong></p>
<p>A guy was in his front lawn raking the leaves, he too took concern for my well being.<br />
"<em>son you OK?</em>"<br />
"<em>yep</em>"<br />
"<em>how come you ain't got no shoes on?</em>"<br />
"<em>I have shoes on....</em>" I say with a confused look.<br />
"<em>no son, no you don't you're barefoot</em>"<br />
I look down and wiggle my toes. "<em>No I'm not.</em>"<br />
I can only imagine the look on his face as I walked away.</p>
<p><strong>OrionFyre:</strong></p>
<p>Cop #2 stops and asks if I'm OK. Alright, now this is getting old....<br />
"<em>yeah I'm OK.</em>"<br />
"<em>there a reason you aren't wearing any shoes?</em>"<br />
"<em>of course.</em>" I say with a full stop. he looks at me as if to say 'annnnd that reason?' I continue "<em>well my friend diagnosed with herpes so I gave him my shoes.</em>" again a full stop<br />
"<em>.....O...K....</em>"<br />
"<em>Anything else officer?</em>" he shakes his head no. "<em>have a great day</em>" I say and wave.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Mahoney:</strong></p>
<p>So I'm standing at the start of an open 5K cross country race. "<em>I have this recurring nightmare</em>", I say to the runner next to me, "<em>that I'm standing at the start of a race and just as they are about to say 'go', I realize I forgot my shoes</em>".<br />
I look down at my bare feet.<br />
"<em>But don't worry. I always wake up just before the race starts</em>".</p>
<p><strong>OrionFyre:</strong></p>
<p>I went for a walk/run this morning around the  mountain bike course. I saw this guy through the trees catching up to me pretty quick running. I was taking a nice leisurely pace as my feet were sorta sore from 12 miles of walking on concrete and gravel and blacktop yesterday. Once he swings around onto the path I'm on I hear his pace slow up.</p>
<p>He comes up next to me "<em>how ya doin?</em>" he asks. "<em>doing good</em>" I say and smile politely.<br />
"<em>mind if I ask you a question?</em>" he asks, "<em>sure...</em>" I glance down at his shoes. "<em>wait, how come you're wearing shoes!?!?</em>"</p>
<p>He gave me a look like 'OK...'<br />
"<em>no for real</em>" I continue "<em>how come you're wearing shoes?</em>"<br />
"<em>because.... I don't wanna hurt my feet....</em>"<br />
"<em>oh OK... oh sorry, what were you gonna ask?</em>"<br />
"<em>I was gonna ask how come you're barefoot.</em>"<br />
"<em>oh that's an easy one.</em>" I say with a full stop.<br />
We go about another hundred feet before he prods for more "<em>so why ARE you barefoot.</em>"<br />
I shrug "<em>I don't wanna hurt my feet.</em>"</p>
<p><strong>And of course my own experience...</strong></p>
<p>The closest I've had was one mum called be "<em>barking mad</em>" and another, whilst I was out running in the rain, shouted "<em>You've left your shoes behind</em>", to which I replied "<em>At least they're not getting wet</em>" as I padded along barefoot enjoying splashing in the puddles like a child.</p>
