Prof Tim f*****g Noakes just changed them. You probably missed it - right?! Go to your bookshelf, grab your copy of The Lore of Running (yes, I know you got one, perhaps you using it as a doorstop - that’s one big f******g book) and rip out the nutrition chapter. The dude got it wrong!<br />

<p>If you're easily offended by rude words, be brave and venture on.  The message is the important part.</p>
