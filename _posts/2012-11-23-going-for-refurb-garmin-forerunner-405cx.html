<p>So my Garmin Forerunner 405CX has given up the ghost again.  After a lot of <a href="/new-garmin-or-refurb">umming and aaahhhing about whether I should go the refurb route or buy a different watch</a> (I thought about the Garmin Forerunner 610), I've decided to go for the refurb.</p>
<p>It'll cost Â£78.30 vs Â£224 for a new Forerunner 610.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this watch I'm sending back is a refurb replacement for this exact issue I experienced around about this time last year.  I think I'm spotting a pattern here: the watch (either new or refurb) seems to develop a battery fault with about a year of constant use:</p>
<p>I purchased my original Garmin Forerunner 405CX on 26 January 2010.<br />
I contacted Garmin about the watch no longer holding charge on 12 January 2011.  They replaced it under warranty with a refurb.<br />
I contacted Garmin about the refurb developing the same problem yesterday, 22 November 2012</p>
<p>Maybe this is just my luck, we'll see.  Hopefully I don't have to write a similar post in 12-14 months from now.</p>
<p>Holding thumbs the refurb will be with me before I head off to sunny South Africa for my holibobs, I'm not holding my breath though.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I've just realised there is no pattern. Now I've re-read this, I realised I got just under a year off the first watch and just under 2 for the second.  Hopefully I'll get closer to 3 for the 3rd ðŸ™‚</p>
