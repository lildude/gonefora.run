<p>The London Evening Standard has a <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/health/article-23784560-ditch-your-trainers-and-run-barefoot.do"> chat with Galahad Clark</a>, founder of Terra Plana, about barefoot running.  Some interesting names are dropped too including Jonathan Ross, Ben Fogle and Bear Grylls; apparently they're all vocal fans of going barefoot.</p>
