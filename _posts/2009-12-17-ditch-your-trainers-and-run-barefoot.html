<p>The London Evening Standard has a <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/health/ditch-your-trainers-and-run-barefoot-6780890.html"> chat with Galahad Clark</a>, founder of Terra Plana, about barefoot running.  Some interesting names are dropped too including Jonathan Ross, Ben Fogle and Bear Grylls; apparently they're all vocal fans of going barefoot.</p>
