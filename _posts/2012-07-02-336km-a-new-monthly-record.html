<p>Last month was a bumper month for running for me.  Check it out...</p>

<p>If you add up all those numbers on the right, and subtract the 3 days' running from May, you get a nice round total of 336.30km.  Now how's that for a lot of running in a single month.</p>
<p>Unlike my previous month, this month was pretty much exclusively running.  I didn't do any dedicated weights sessions or swimming as I find both of these impact my running more than I'd like.  I might bring those back during the winter months when I don't always want to head outside.</p>
<p>So not only did <a href="/103km-in-one-week-a-new-record">I run over 100km in a single week</a> last month, I also set a new record for the highest mileage in a single month.  Great stuff and best of all I felt pretty good all month with the exception of the end of last week when I was feeling a little tired from a couple of late nights and some tough racing.  This <a href="/training-and-diet-update">MAF training</a> is really working for me.</p>
<p>July won't be a bumper month as I've got a week's holiday booked, but I think it'll still be a big month as I plan to start squeezing in more of those 100+ kilometre weeks when I get back.</p>
