![Valencia Marathon](/img/valencia-marathon.jpg)

After a lot of umming and aaahhing, I've finally made up my mind and have decided I'll be doing the Valencia Marathon for my autumn marathon this year.  It's a fast flat route in a beautiful city with a great climate at that time of year.

I've finally got some motivation to get back out onto the road, but only from next week; it's way too hot out there this week ðŸ˜‰

**Update:** I've just noticed that under Spanish age categories, I fall into the "Veteran A" age group... this will be my first race as a veteran and it's three years earlier than I was expecting ðŸ˜¢.
