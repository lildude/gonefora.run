<p>For several years now I've had a recurring discomfort and sometimes searing pain in my lower back and right sacroiliac joint.  I can't pin-point any one action that causes the discomfort or anything that aggravates it, but it seems to crop up every 3 to 4 months and then hangs about for a month or two.  Then all is well until it's next occurrence several months later.</p>
<p>I have managed to work out that if I am feeling the discomfort, it's easier for me to take things one step further into the world of excruciating pain if I sit a bit wonky on the sofa and get up without correcting my posture first.  Thankfully I can catch this just as it starts to pinch and avoid the pain, though I have caught myself 3 times "pinching" something without any warning. This has left me almost immobile for a week at a time.</p>
<p>As this seems to be a recurrent thing that isn't going away, I'm off to the physio today to get a full assessment. Hopefully that will shed some light on the cause and provide a means to resolve it.  I suspect it may be due to my slightly wonky spine.</p>
<p>On the running side of things, the last two weeks have been good.  No problems with my running at all and I'm feeling great.  I'm deliberately taking things quite slowly so I don't introduce any problems and have decided to follow a more structured training programme.  Hopefully the gradual increase in volume and pace will keep things on course for a cracking race in about 16 weeks time.  Until then I'll be keeping the racing to a bare minimum.</p>
