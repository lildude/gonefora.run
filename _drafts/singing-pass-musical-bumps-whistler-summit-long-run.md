When in Whistler... you run the closest hoooooooge mountain you can found by simply looking out the back window üòÅ. That's what I did today and what an awesome run.

It was probably the toughest run I've ever completed with over 1931m of elevation but it was all made brilliant by the beautiful scenery everywhere I ran.  Things turned particularly tough not long into Musical Bumps with no choice but to walk in large sections between there and the peak.  I threw in a few detours to take photos too.

The scariest thing of the whole run? Running on paths only a foot wide? The sheer drop in places? Crossing a creek that looked like an avalanche had just gone through it? Nope, the open chair lift down from the summit to The Roundhouse.

I don't like heights when I don't feel secure and having my feet dangling below me was a little disconcerting when I first got on.  I soon relaxed and felt a little more secure and enjoyed the very quiet trip back down to the Roundhouse.

My Luna Sandals worked a treat too. Absolutely brilliant.

Other stuff:
- awesome views
- cold snow melt run off streams taste wonderful
- snow proved a useful water source too, but you need to dig a little bit at the surface snow is dirty
- saw a bear, but only on the gondola ride back down... didn't actually see any whilst running ‚òπÔ∏è  Didn't get a pic either ‚òπÔ∏è
- the chair lift and gondola are free to get back down the hill... come on, it's the least they can do if you've taken the effort to run all the way up.
