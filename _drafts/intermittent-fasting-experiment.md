I listen to a lot of podcasts on my runs and one topic that crops up quite a bit on a few of them is the topic of intermittent fasting and how it can be used for weight loss, recovery and general health and well being. Intrigued by this, I decided I'd give intermittent fasting a go and see how it affects me. I already perform most of my Sunday long runs fasted, except for the cup of tea I use to wake me up so why not give it a go with the rest of my training?

My plan is to do a full 24 hour fast on Mondays (ie nothing from dinner on Sunday until dinner on Monday) and a 16 hour fast on Fridays (ie skip breakfast on Fridays). Why those days? They're both recovery days so I don't need mountains of energy, and they fit nicely either side of the weekend when I'm more likely to deviate from my normal LCHF diet... mainly because that's beer drinking time ðŸ˜‰.
