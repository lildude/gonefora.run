New PB: 2:43:39.

This new PB, along with my fast half marathon PBs is already opening doors. I've gained _free_ **elite** entry into this year's San Francisco marathon.

I also qualify for a championship start at next year's London Marathon
Ran 170k the week before.
Only a training run. Tapered by cutting training significantly.
Worked well.

Paced for 2:45 but felt good so went for it.

Smashed a new PB by about 4 mins.
