Hey look at this, a summary of my 2016 year of training and racing, and it's only nearly two months late üòÅ.

Lets start off with my training.

## Training

With no races confirmed on my calendar other than the Berlin marathon in October, and on [reflection early last year](/week-in-review-28-dec-3-jan-16), I decided I'd start the year working on my aerobic base by bringing back MAF, in a big way, and then dot it with a few very hard sessions in a polarised 80/20 style of training favoured by the elite runners.

This worked well and I got into a good groove building up the miles and promptly forgot about running any other marathons and soon missed the opportunity to enter a spring marathon.  My work travel commitments also didn't make it easy to plan a spring marathon.

My wife and I had an early summer holiday this year which worked out quite conveniently from a training perspective.  The week after we got back made it exactly 17 weeks until the Berlin Marathon which was one week short of that needed for the 18 week Pfitzinger 70-85 miles per week 18 week programme from the [Advanced Marathoning book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0026IUOX2/) which I'd read and thought would be a great programme, with a few tweaks, for the Berlin marathon.

I followed the programme pretty closely with a few exceptions:

- I threw in a few half marathons, 10k's and parkruns which weren't called for by the programme,
- all runs which weren't recovery or didn't specify a pace were run at MAF - 144 to 149 BPM,
- all sessions with paces were run at or close to PB pace for each distance specified in the programme.

This approach ensured I built up a huge aerobic base whilst also allowing me to continue with the polarised training I'd started doing at the beginning of the year.

As the weeks progressed, this proved to be a great programme and strategy for me. I was getting faster, the runs felt easier and I wasn't struggling with the high mileage at all. This training brought my times right down with me getting close to my 5k and 10k PBs, I set a new 5 mile PB (29:05 offroad and 3rd place) and I also managed to set a half-marathon PB six weeks out from Berlin on an undulating course I really wasn't expecting to dip under 80 minutes on, let alone set a new PB of 79:09.

So how much of my training was at MAF in the end? This much:

This is from [SmashRun](http://en-gb.smashrun.com/colin.seymour).  I don't have any control over the ranges they use here but as you can see most of my training was in the recovery and aerobic zones, which is expected with MAF. When you flip the graph into percentage mode - I don't like this view, but it illustrates the point well - you can see I spent closer to 90% of my time in aerobic or recovery heart ranges:

I'm pretty chuffed with this consistency and confirmation that going slower definitely makes you a faster running, and without injury too.


## Racing

2016 was a good year for my racing.  These are my best times for the year, compared to my PBs:


| Distance | 2016 | PB | Notes
|----|------|----|-------
| 5K | 17:13 | 17:10 | Offroad parkrun.
| 10K | 36:31 | 35:18 | This is technically an "official" PB as my actual PB isn't from a UKA licensed race so doesn't appear on the Power of 10.
| 5M | 29:05 | 29:05 | New PB, offroad and 3rd place.
| 10M | 1:01:51 | 1:00:21 | Too knackered for a PB, but probably possible.
| ¬Ω Marathon | 79:10 | 79:10 | New PB on undulating course and 4th place.
| Marathon | 2:47:31 | 2:47:31 | New PB by over 6 minutes and 6th place.




## Diet



## Travel

Last year work and pleasure took me to:

- San Francisco,
- Amsterdam,
- Berlin,
- Denver,
- Singapore,
- Majorca,

... and I ensured I went out for at least one run in each location.

## What's on the Cards for 2015?

- Wokingham Half,
- Maidenhead 10,
- Fleet Half,
- Manchester Marathon
- Comrades Marathon

... and then an autumn marathon. I'm also going to see if I can squeeze in the San Francisco marathon as it may just co-incide with one of my trips in the summer.

2016 was a fantastic year for my running. I trained more than I ever have in the past, raced well, ate well and all whilst enjoying work and doing a fair bit of travelling for work.
