Thursday was a very exciting day for me... it was new bike day!!! My first new bike for over 10 years and it's a beauty.

I've been hankering for a new bike for a few years following the introduction of the Cycle2Work scheme at work and spent a long time umming and aaahhing over whether I should get a gravel bike or a road bike. I nearly pulled the trigger a few times on a gravel bike (I really liked the look of the [Trek Checkpoint 7](https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/bikes/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/checkpoint/checkpoint-sl/checkpoint-sl-7/p/29344/?colorCode=reddark) though a tad expensive) but something stopped me at the last moment. Then my legs started playing up and ðŸ¦  lockdown happened so my desire for a new bike peaked... as did everyone else's ðŸ˜ž. It was during this time that I realised I'd spent more time on the road with my current cyclocross bike than I did off and the same would probably apply for the next bike. I'd also really enjoyed the time I'd spent out exploring the countryside roads so I switched my attention to road bikes, specifically "endurance" road bikes (for the more relaxed geometry).

As with any big purchase I spent an inordinate amount of time searching the internet for endurance bikes, found a few I really liked ([Trek Domane SL5](https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/bikes/road-bikes/performance-road-bikes/domane/domane-sl/domane-sl-5/p/28311/), [Canyon Endurace SL7](https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/road-bikes/endurance-bikes/endurace/cf-sl/endurace-cf-sl-7-disc/2947.html) and the [Ribble Endurance](https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/ribble-endurance-sl-disc-red-shimano-ultegra-di2/)) but everywhere was sold out with insanely long waiting times (6+ months in most cases) or no indication of if any more stock will become available. That's when I remembered [Dolan Bikes](https://www.dolan-bikes.com/) and found their [Dolan Tuono Disc Carbon Road Bike](https://www.dolan-bikes.com/tuono-disc-carbon-road/) which looked amazing, with more configuration choice than I'd ever seen, and best of all, they stated a dispatch date within 45 working days. 

I was a little sceptical the delivery timeframe would be met given the insane demand and delays in the supply chain but decided I'd dilly-dallied enough and the [Dolan Tuono Disc Carbon Road Bike - Shimano Ultegra R8020 HDR](https://www.dolan-bikes.com/dolan-tuono-disc-carbon-road-bike-simano-ultegra-r8020-hdr/) looked amazing for the price. So I pulled the trigger, configured the bike precisely as I wanted (but not the wheels in the picture on their website - they're Â£775 extra!!) and placed my order on 7 September, requested my Cycle2Work voucher which I submitted on 15 September and received confirmation of my order that day. Forty working days later (10 November) I received confirmation my bike had been dispatched and would be with me the next day.
