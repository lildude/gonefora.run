<p>A helmet has never saved my life. It has however somehow saved me from grazing and shmooshing my face into pizza topping many a time and it is purely for this vane reason I continue to wear a helmet. I don't for one minute believe a helmet made of thin plastic and compressed polystyrene could protect me from the bone-breaking impacts I've sustained over the years, it will however keep me pretty.<br />
