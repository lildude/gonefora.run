I was going to include this info in my race report, but it turned out to be an incredibly huge post so I thought it best to move the training and build up into it's own post... this one.

I also promptly forgot about running any other marathons and soon missed the opportunity to enter a spring marathon.  My work travel commitments also didn't make it easy to plan a spring marathon.  In the end I opted for building my aerobic base hugely using the MAF approach coupled with the occasional high intensity run giving me a very polarised training programme.  This worked well for the first half of the year and I was soon in good shape.

My wife and I had an early summer holiday this year which worked out quite conveniently from a training perspective.  The week after we got back made it exactly 17 weeks until the Berlin Marathon which was one week short of that needed for the 18 week Pfitzinger 70-85 mile per week 18 week programme from the [Advanced Marathoning book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0026IUOX2/) which I'd read and thought would be a great programme, with a few tweaks, for the Berlin marathon.

I followed the programme pretty closely with a few exceptions:

- I threw in a few half marathons, 10k's and parkruns which weren't called for by the programme,
- all runs which weren't recovery or didn't specify a pace were run at MAF - 144 to 149 BPM,
- all sessions with paces were run at or close to PB pace for each distance specified in the programme.

This approach ensured I built up a huge aerobic base whilst also allowing me to continue with the polarised training I'd started doing at the beginning of the year.

As the weeks progressed, this proved to be a great programme and strategy for me. I was getting faster, the runs felt easier and I wasn't struggling with the high mileage at all. This training brought my times right down with me getting close to my 5k and 10k PBs, I set a new 5 mile PB and I also managed to set a half-marathon PB six weeks out from Berlin on an undulating course I really wasn't expecting to dip under 80 minutes on, let alone set a PB of 79:09.
