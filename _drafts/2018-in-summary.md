Wow!! Look at that, 2019 already ðŸ˜±. It feels like it was only yesterday that I wrote up my [2017 in Summary](https://gonefora.run/2017-in-summary) post. I quite like the format of last year's post so I'm going to do the same thing this year. Like last year, I've also just got back from my first run of the year.

## Quick Stats

Strava has done some of the work for me in my [2018 Year in Sport video]() and finishes off with this nice summary, which includes all the cycling and running in the same stats:

Seems Strava don't read this blog, or if they do, chose not to implement any changes, so once again, lets turn to [SmashRun](https://smashrun.com) for a bit more info than Strava has to offer as this year is definitely my best year to date, even better than last year:

## Training

Once again, MAF formed the foundation of my training, but this year I concentrate more on strength training and plyometrics for two reasons: 1. Comrades was a down run and it's brutal on the legs and 2. injury prevention, paying particular attention to my achilles' as they took me out of action for most of January and February. This decision has definitely paid off as I feel so much stronger on my runs.

## Diet

I also introduced intermittant fasting on most my recovery days - Mondays and Thursdays - to encourage more fat adaptation, but also see if I could gain some of the benefits that are meant to come with intermittent fasting from an autophagy and mental clarity perspective. I can't comment on the autophagy side of things and this needs sciency stuffs but I can definitely say my mental clarity was fantastic on those days. My recovery seemed pretty good too, despite also lifting weights on these days.

## What's on the Cards for 2018?
