After a lot of umming and aaahhing, I've finally made up my mind and have decided I'll be doing the Valencia Marathon for my autumn marathon this year.  It's a fast flat route in a beautiful city with a great climate at that time of year.

I've finally got some motivation to get back out onto the road, but only from next week; it's way too hot out there this week :wink:
