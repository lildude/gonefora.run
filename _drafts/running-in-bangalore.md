<p>Bangalore has to be one of the toughest placed to go for a run.</p>
<p>The roads are ALWAYS busy, the pavements are full of people or falling holes and are far from easy to run on.</p>
<p>Then there are the stay dogs and cited to deal with... Yes, even in the middle of the city you get cows and did winding into the road.</p>
<p>And when it rains in monsoon season it gets even worse. Then you have huge puddles to deal with and leap over our avoid and also look out for the one in the road as the cars and auto-rickshaws have absolutely no regard for pedestrians. Crossing the roads is also a nightmare as pedestrians have no right of way... you need to spot a gap and leg it or use one of the locals as a guide/barrier.</p>
<p>Tonight's run proved very eventful and I really couldn't get into a groove. I think the rest of my running is going to have to be on the treadmill or round and round a nearby park or athletics track.</p>
