Wooohooo!!! With a day and a bit to go in April, here's March's summary ðŸŽ‰. Thank goodness I'm not paid to blog else I'd find myself unemployed PDQ!!


Got a new PB for the half marathon at the Fleet Half... 1:17:02 chip time. I feel a little cheated by those two seconds. Had I known, I'm sure I could have dug in just that teeny weeny bit more to dip under 77 mins. On the plus side, at least I've got a target for my next half ðŸ˜„.
