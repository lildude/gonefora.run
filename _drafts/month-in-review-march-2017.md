With a week to go, here's March's summary.

Got a new PB for the half marathon at the Fleet Half... 1:17:02 chip time. I feel a little cheated by those two seconds. Had I known, I'm sure I could have dug in just that teeny weeny bit more to dip under 77 mins. On the plus side, at least I've got a target for my next half ðŸ˜„.
