Monday: rest day. Good HRV despite long run, booze and carbs on Sunday.

Tuesday: My morning readiness HRV reading was incredibly low this morning.  Recently I've found I've been getting somewhere in the region of 70-72 for my reading.  This morning it was right down at 44 and I can't think why.  No booze last night, no carbs, a good night's sleep, no stress yet my HRV was terrible.

I had planned on doing a MAF test today and nearly didn't, but then I thought: "Hey wouldn't it be a good experiment to see if the HRV reading translated into poorer performance, which is easily measured with a MAF test", and what do you know, it did, and quite considerably, though I can't put all the blame on a low HRV as a relatively strong westerly wind picked just as I started my run and at least of my MAF test route is heading west.

Didn't feel too bad during the MAF test - not my best, but certainly not bad - and certainly didn't feel tired or drained at the end of it.  I actually felt quite invigorated.

Will see what my HRV reading is tomorrow and if it's poor again I'll keep the run short and then see what Thursday brings.  If Thurs is good and the weather is good, I'll try the MAF test again.
