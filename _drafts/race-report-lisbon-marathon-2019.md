### Training

### Pre-Race

### Race

Lovely race along the coast. Undulating at first and then pretty flat. Quite chuffed with my time given Iâ€™ve barely run in just over two months. No signs of the shin pain during the entire run. Faded towards the end when it got hot and my HR got stuck around 180bpm. Random thought after the run: If Iâ€™d run in the Nike cheater shoes, theyâ€™d have got me close enough to sub-3 that Iâ€™d have made the effort for the rest ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£

Chip time: 3:11:59 - yaaaas!!! Sub-3:12 ðŸ˜œ
