This passed weekend I joined 11 of my US-based colleagues as their ringer in the [Ragnar Napa relay](http://www.ragnarrelay.com/race/napavalley).

Results: http://www.webscorer.com/race?raceid=28755&live=1

68th over all out of 502 teams
63rd of 464 regular (as opposed to Ultra) teams
38th of 329  Mixed Open teams

We took it so casually and really weren't very prepared that it is very surprising we did so well.

Interesting only 6 DNFs... pretty impressive for an event so long and tough.


Organisation could be better - water stations were the biggest complaint.
Surprised there wasn't more commercial action at the big exchanges.

Medals got stuck in customs so we got a belt buckle - who wears these things - and an extra beer token. Medals will be posted to us.
