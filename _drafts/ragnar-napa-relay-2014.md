<img src="/img/ragnar-logo.png" class="alignleft" width="158" height="160"/> Way back on the 19th and 20th of September I joined 11 of my US-based colleagues as their ringer in the [Ragnar Napa Valley relay](https://www.ragnarrelay.com/race/napavalley) and what an awesome event.

For the uninformed, [Ragnar](https://www.ragnarrelay.com) put on a series of overnight relays around the US with the Ragnar Napa Valley being one of the newest.  The Napa Valley relay covers 205 miles (~330km) from Golden Gate park in San Francisco to Calistoga, just north of Napa broken up into 36 legs of varing lengths:

Each team is made up of twelve people, split into two groups, with each runner running three legs.  For those crazy few, there's also the option of creating an ultra team of only 6 runners with each running running 6 legs.

One of the guys at work posed the idea of doing the relay at the end of March and we quickly filled all 12 slots as people opted in.  I quickly volunteered as it sounded like an awesome event and the perfect opportunity to get over to San Francisco and bond with some of my colleagues.  I was also planning on using this as my last long run before the Bournemouth Marathon. Of course time took its toll and people dropped like flies resulting in a bit of a last minute scramble to get a full compliment.  I think we ended up with only 3 or 4 of the original entrants in the final 12. We didn't get any people offering to be our volunteers so we paid the extra for the race-provided volunteers.  We also winged it with only one driver driving van one.  I was in van two and those who could and wanted to drive took turns doing so.  I wasn't allowed to drive as I don't have US car insurance.

<img class="alignleft" src="/img/fithub.jpg" /> With about 2 weeks to go we came to the realisation this was happening and we'd done absolutely bugger all to plan things other than get the team entered :grinning:.  Thankfully our driver from van one, Heather, stepped up and became mom and the team organiser.  She got us all together and in the last week we  arranged all our food and drinks, first aid kits, wet wipes, reflective vests, headlamps and tail lights and loads of other things, including initial meeting times for each of the vans and their runners.

We all agreed that we'd cover the basics and then wing it by using local restuarants and shops to stock up on anything we'd forgotten or fancied.

I was pretty impressed how quickly we sorted this all out and by the Thursday evening we were all set to go.

Friday morning, van one's runners were up bright and early for their scheduled start time of 9:30 in Golden Gate park.  They needed to get there at least an hour before to register and for their mandatory safety briefing and to collect their T-shirts and crossing flags - it seems if you wave a bright orange flag when crossing the road, the cops turn a blind eye on the jay walking rule :wink:. Those of us in van two had a nice lie-in and made our way up to exchange 6 for about midday for our registration, T-shirts and safety briefing.

Having a lie-in was nice, but it did mean everyone in van two did their first legs in the heat of the day.  As it turned out, this became a bit of a trend.  Van one definitely had the preferable running times - earlier in the day and night - with van two getting the stinkers of the heat of the day and stoopid o'clock in the morning.  Van two's legs were also the tougher and longer legs.

They then went and grabbed some lunch and made their way up to exchange 12 for a bit of rest whilst runners seven to twelve ran their legs.

Van two then

I was runner ten so by the time I was handed the baton and sent off on my first leg, it was incredibly hot.  My first leg was just over 10km and marked as "very hard" in the route description.  I set off at a good pace and soon came to the conclusion they're been a little melodramatic with their definition of "very hard"... the start of the run was almost entirely flat and slightly downhill.  I was then put in my place at about 7km when I rounded a corner and was presented with a huge hill which climbed for nearly 2km.  I battled through, overtook 18 people - I was still counting at that point - and finished my run in 44:03, which wasn't too bad at all.



Results: https://www.webscorer.com/race?raceid=28755&live=1

68th over all out of 502 teams
63rd of 464 regular (as opposed to Ultra) teams
38th of 329  Mixed Open teams

We took it so casually and really weren't very prepared that it is very surprising we did so well.

Interesting only 6 DNFs... pretty impressive for an event so long and tough.


Organisation could be better - water stations were the biggest complaint.
Surprised there wasn't more commercial action at the big exchanges.

Medals got stuck in customs so we got a belt buckle - who wears these things - and an extra beer token. Medals will be posted to us.
