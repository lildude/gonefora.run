It was around about this time last year that I noticed the Berlin Marathon was close to opening up entry for this year's race and I decided, I'd give it a go.  Entry is via a ballot system and I had nothing to lose if I wasn't selected as I'd get my money back. So on 21 October 2015 I stumped up my cash and put my name on the list.

A few months later I received notification that I'd been selected and the wheels were put in motion for my first attempt at the world's fastest marathon.  With the memory of managing to successfully run a 2:53 marathon at London after blowing up spectacularly, I set myself the goal of running a 2:45 marathon and set to putting everything in place in my training to get me there.

I also promptly forgot about running any other marathons and soon missed the opportunity to enter a spring marathon.  My work travel commitments also didn't make it easy to plan a spring marathon.  In the end I opted for building my aerobic base hugely using the MAF approach coupled with the occasional high intensity run giving me a very polarised training programme.  This worked well for the first half of the year and I was soon in good shape.

My wife and I had an early summer holiday this year which worked out quite conveniently from a training perspective.  The week after we got back made it exactly 17 weeks until the Berlin Marathon which was one week short of that needed for the 18 week Pfitzinger 70-85 mile per week 18 week programme from the [Advanced Marathoning book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0026IUOX2/) which I'd read and thought would be a great programme, with a few tweaks, for the Berlin marathon.

I followed the programme pretty closely with a few exceptions:

- I threw in a few half marathons, 10k's and parkruns which weren't called for by the programme,
- all runs which weren't recovery or didn't specify a pace were run at MAF - 144 to 149 BPM,
- all sessions with paces were run at or close to PB pace for each distance specified in the programme.

This approach ensured I built up a huge aerobic base whilst also allowing me to continue with the polarised training I'd started doing at the beginning of the year.

As the weeks progressed, this proved to be a great programme and strategy for me. I was getting faster, the runs felt easier and I wasn't struggling with the high mileage at all. This training brought my times right down close to my 5k and 10k PBs, I set a new 5 mile PB and I also managed to set a half-marathon PB six weeks out from Berlin on an undulating course I really wasn't expecting to dip under 80 minutes on, let alone set a PB of 79:09.

So 17 weeks and over 1500 kilometres later I found myself in Berlin wondering around the race expo with my goodie bag containing my Championchip, race number and a pile of other stuff you get at these race expo's, checking out the various exhibitors pushing their expensive shoes, clothes, devices and sugary products. The excitement was building and I was starting to get anxious about the race. I was feeling good and was confident my training had gone well but I still remained pretty anxious.

I ate well, kept the alcohol down and really enjoyed the weekend until lunch time on Saturday when the anxiety really started to get to me. By early evening I was wishing the race was over and done with. I couldn't sit still or concentrate on anything and as all the TV was in German, I couldn't even watch TV to unwind and clear my mind. I barely slept a wink that night.  I'd doze off for a bit and then wake up panicking about the race or worrying about my training or thinking about my pacing strategy.

And as luck would have it, I finally managed to switch my mind off about 30 minutes before my alarm went off at 6am. I like to get in a bulletproof coffee and have it clear my system before I run so waking up this early is a necessity, especially as I like to get to the race start at least 45 minutes early and I'd prefer it if I didn't have to use the portaloo for a pre-race #2.

I left the apartment at 7:15 and took a leisurely stroll across Tiergaten to the athletes start area and got there with plenty of time to spare. It took me a little while to locate me allocated baggage pen but once I did, I stripped off and dropped off my bag. All bags had to be dropped off by 8:45 and as this was a huge race I wanted to make sure I'd dropped my bag off before the masses.  It was a pleasant morning too so I had no fears of freezing to death before the start.

After dropping off my bag I jogged very easily with the crowds to the entrance to my allocated starting pen. I then milled around there for a bit watching more and more people make their way to the start and watching the commentary on the big screens above the start line. I was here that I was reassured that human beings are disgusting creatures. I can understand the need for a nervous or "to be safe" squeezy wee in the bushes just before the start of a race - we all do it - but I saw several people disappearing into the bushes for a dump!!!  Come on people!!  This is a public park... you _don't_ do number twos in the bushes, especially when there are plenty portaloos with very short queues!!!

I squeezed in another quick warm up run and then made my way to my allocated pen. Thanks to my 2:53 from London, I was allocated to starting pen C, two back from the elites, with great views of the big screens over the start line and good acoustics so I could hear all the commentary too.  From here I watches the wheelchair peeps head off, then the recumbent bikes and then it was out turn.  At bang on 9:15 we were sent on our way, but not before the guy two behind me decided he'd have his squeezy wee right there in the starting pen!!



In retrospect I think skipping a spring marathon was a bad idea. It put too much me in a situation where all my marathon eggs were in a single basket so to speak.


Too much pressure, not enough sleep, probably a mineral deficiency and a large part physcological.

Started with a twitch in my right sacroilliac joint which then became cramp in my lower right quad, lower left quad, right calf, right arch and right shin muscle.  Ended up run-walking most of the second half or plodding when the cramping had subsided a bit.

When I finished, hobbled to meeting area, lay down and then my legs really started to seaze up. Left hammy cramped and then my right leg when nuts. Calf turned into a writhing rock hard block for about 3 minutes. The fibres were firing constantly and my calf twitched so much that it looked like there was something in my calf trying to get out.

Def think I put too much pressure to perform on myself.
