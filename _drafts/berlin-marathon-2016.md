17 weeks of training ended in :bang:.

Too much pressure, not enough sleep, probably a mineral deficiency and a large part physcological.

Started with a twitch in my right sacroilliac joint which then became cramp in my lower right quad, lower left quad, right calf, right arch and right shin muscle.  Ended up run-walking most of the second half or plodding when the cramping had subsided a bit.

When I finished, hobbled to meeting area, lay down and then my legs really started to seaze up. Left hammy cramped and then my right leg when nuts. Calf turned into a writhing rock hard block for about 3 minutes. The fibres were firing constantly and my calf twitched so much that it looked like there was something in my calf trying to get out.

Def think I put too much pressure to perform on myself.
