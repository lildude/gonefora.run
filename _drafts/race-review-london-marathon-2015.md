NOTES:

- great race
- way more spectators than I anticipated. 2 deep most of the way round the course
- aimed for 2:45 but got caught up in the excitement and reached half-way nearly 3 mins ahead of plan
- seriously bad negative split
- needed a pee break between 27 & 28k - first time ever. Put that down to having to get into the start pen so far in advance of the start.
- would do again, but prob not next year
- goodie bag had deo which had been pressed leaving everything tasting of soap
