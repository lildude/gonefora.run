### Training

### Pre-Race

### Race


There was absolutely no way I was going to be able to race this on the teeny weeny amount of training Iâ€™ve done in the build up to this race so decided to put my Stride power meter to the test and ran by power. According to the app and calculations I should have run at 292W. 

After getting over the excitement of the start, and a weeeeeee break just after 6km, I settled into a power range between 290 and 305 and tried to stick to it, especially the lower end. I didnâ€™t look at pacing at all the entire run other than when my watching beeped for the auto-lap at each km and ran every step of the way. Turns out running by power actually works. Ended up running a pretty consistent pace and the effort felt consistent too, except for the last two km when I picked up the power a bit. Also got to enjoy that feeling of watching the tide go out and then come back.

Over half an hour slower than my PB set late last year but not bad considering my injury, but still an enjoyable run in a great city. 

Gonna have to give this power malarkey more attention but first, I shall be spending December fully recovering and getting fat.
