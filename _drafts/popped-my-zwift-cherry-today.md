I'm still fighting pain in my left shin/calf area (I'll go to the doc soon, promise 😉) so I'm still not running very much. I am however trying to build my fitness using the rower, SkiErg, Wattbike and swimming in the hope that when I can start running again, it's just a matter of reminding my legs what they need to do.

Late last year I started doing workouts on the Wattbike from the Wattbike app and there were quite enjoyable. I got in a good workout and concentrating on the app allowed me to cycle for a lot longer than I would have in the past when BBC News on the gym TV was all I had for entertainment. Today I changed things up and made it much more entertaining...

I popped my Zwift 🍒 and performed my first ever Zwift workout, using a Wattbike, and I really enjoyed it.

This is waaaay more engaging than the Wattbike app workouts and I really liked how the graphics and sound effects changed as the terrain changed. I even felt the urge to speed up my cadence as the visuals and sound effects indicated I was going downhill. As I was on a Wattbike Trainer/Pro and not an Atom, I had to do the resistance changing myself, so I can only imagine how much more enjoyable this is on a fancy trainer that automatically adjusts the settings based on Zwift.

I enjoyed the ride experience so much, I've let a few moths out of my wallet... just enough for Zwift but not enough for a fancy trainer... yet 😀.  It is now tempting to get a smart trainer and new bike, because my bikes are all dirty and over eight years old, but I'm not sure I can justify the purchase to the Mrs just yet. Maybe a fancy indoor bike like the Wattbike Atom or that she can also use will be easier 😬.

I'm also going to have to be one of those peeps that takes their iPads to the gym too as the UI is a little on the small side for easy navigation from an iPhone. I also need to remember to take my bluetooth HRM as the ANT+ HR data from the Wattbike doesn't transfer back to Zwift over the bluetooth link.
