This week I didn't do much running. Instead I spent the time drinking beer and socialising with my colleagues in a swanky hotel in Colorado Springs.

Ran the Colombine Trail on Tuesday - still tired from doing the incline, a longish run on Friday - tired from jetlag and the last week, long run on Sunday - tired.
