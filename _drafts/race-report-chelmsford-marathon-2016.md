![Chelmsford Marathon - 23 October 2016](/assets/chelmsford-marathon-logo.jpg){:class="alignright" width="200" height="167"} In a bid to make up for a [disastrous Berlin Marathon](https://barefootrunner.co.uk/berlin-marathon-2016) I hunted out a flat-ish marathon a month later to see if having another go would get me the results I wanted and proved my training was right and I could run 2:45 or pretty damn close, and this is what I came up with: the [Chelmsford Marathon](http://www.chelmsfordmarathon.org.uk/).

The race website [describes the course](http://www.chelmsfordmarathon.org.uk/course-2016/) as...

> The Chelmsford Marathon course is a single lapped 26.2 mile course classified as fairly flat with some undulations. The course comprises of road running and tarmac paths.

... which sounded ideal. I prefer single lapped courses and fairly flat should mean a good time would be possible, and best of all, unlike Abingdon which was on the same weekend and would have been the ideal "second attempt" race, they were still taking entries.  So I entered and then spent the next month keeping my running ticking over by repeating the final month of the programme I used for Berlin.

I'd checked the results from last year for this race and saw that it was a small event with around 800 finishers, but I wasn't expecting to to be quite so small and low-key.  We got to the race HQ in Central Park at 8am to find the place almost devoid of runners and spectators.  Everything was all setup as you'd expect, there just weren't that many people milling around which is quite unusual.

I picked up my finishers t-shirt and then the wife and I had a little wonder around the park. It was during that little wonder that everyone appeared out of the woodwork and the field became the bustling hive of activity I'm used to seeing, including the really long queue to the portaloos, which thankfully I'd had the instinct to use just before we went for our mozy.

I warmed up, stripped down, packed my pockets and then made my way over to the Shire Hall for the start, along with everyone else. The start showed more signs that this was going to be a small race. The start area was mostly open to spectators and runners and the pace-band signs were pretty close together. My wife stayed with me chatting until about 3mins to go when I handed her my t-shirt and they started with the pre-race announcements. Just before 9 they moved us all forward to the start line and then we were off.

Everything so far was proving this would be a small race and this was further confirmed when I was pleasantly surprised to find myself in 9th place less than a kilometre into the race and the 10th place person wasn't keeping up. The lead guys weren't too far ahead of me and didn't seem to be pulling away too quickly either. It was so tempting to pick up my pace and run with them, but I restrained myself and dropped into a good rhythm - whilst I was doing a fair amount of experimenting with this race, flying off with the lead guys and then holding on for dear life was _not_ on the cards.

I felt really good and ticked over the k's as we wound our way around the east side of the city before heading back along the canal, through Central Park and out into the fields. I'd move up to 7th place by the 4 mile marker and could just see the 6th place guy in the distance.

I kept a pretty consistent pace and very slowly reeled in the 6th place guy who did go out with the lead chaps and seemed to be starting to struggle. I got to half way bang on schedule for an even-split 2:45 marathon, despite having to pause briefly around 18k to yank the insole from my left shoe that had wiggled its way most of the way out of my shoe, and I was still feeling really good and confident my changes in preparation were starting to pay off. The k's were ticking over with ease and whilst my right sacroiliac joint was starting to feel tight, an exaggerated high knee stride or two loosened things up a bit and I fell back into my stride.

And then the "some undulations" started in earnest.  There were a few in the first half of the race but the bulk of them came in the second half. I breezed up some of these but as I tired I naturally found them more of a challenge. Not as much of a challenge as the 6th place guy though üòâ. I caught him at about 28 k's and then started working on the 5th place guy who'd stopped for a whizz and was now only just ahead of me. I caught him at 30 k's, ran just ahead of him for about two k's until he passed me on one of the tougher hills. He pulled a good lead which I reigned in a bit and whilst I got close, I didn't have the mental energy to carry on and pass him in the final stages of the race.  We did however reign in the 4th place chap who worked really hard to prevent us catching him.

It was around the 32k mark that I knew for sure a sub-2:45 finish was off the cards, but not by much.  The undulations were just a little too taxing and I was starting to feel mentally tired. A sub-2:48 however was definitely still on the cards so I used that as my target time.  This helped spur me on for the final few kilometres of the race and helped me keep the 5th place guy in my sights.

In the end I finished in 6th place in a time of 2:47:33 on my watch. I was so chuffed to bits. My training _did_ work after all and my race day experimentation paid off. I'd just finished a marathon strong and smashed my PB by over 6 minutes!!! I didn't get the sub-2:45 I'd wanted going into Berlin but I'd got close and I now know sub-2:45 is definitely possible.

Now back to the experimentation I've mentioned.

As part of assessing my shocking race at Berlin I considered the fact that maybe I'd bonked and bonked early thanks to the added stress I put on myself and the lack of sleep, so decided I'd do a little bit of experimenting with my nutrition before and during this race.  In the month building up to the race I concocted my own electrolyte drink which I was consuming once a day so I could be sure my cramping wasn't due to an electrolyte imbalance and I also read up on carb-loading and race-fueling for the fat-adapted athlete that I am.  Seems I've been expecting too much of my body by trying to rely solely on fat for fuel during these races as I'm running at a pace that is too fast for this to be possible.

So starting Friday I bumped my good carbs right up by packing in more sweet potatoes and fruit and continued through Saturday with Saturday night's dinner being my now-standard pre-race roast chicken, roast squash and roast beetroot.  I ate my normal saurkraut omelette and bulletproof coffee for breakfast and then would rely on gels during the race for in-race fuelling.



 and take gels at set regular intervals. I know you're not meant to experiment on race day, but I'd not had the time to practice properly beyond a single long-ish run the weekend before, and I didn't think it would go too badly if it did; heck it couldn't go worse than it did at Berlin üòÅ.

I decided that I'd take one [HIGH5 EnergyGel Plus](http://highfive.co.uk/product/caffeine/energy-gel-plus/) gel approximately every hour at the water station closest to the hour marks. I also carried a few dates and a spare GU gel "just in case". We were informed there would be nine water stations on the course starting at three miles which worked out to be one every four to five kilometres.  I took my first gel at the water station







Went into this race with no expectations on time. I just had to go with it and see how I got on and if I blew up again, after a month of making sure I consumed enough electrolytes and the few changes I was experimenting with in the race, then so be it.

I went into this race with no expectations on time. I just had to go with it and see how I got on and if I blew up again then so be it. I'd changed a few things in the build up to this race and planned to experiment during the race - I know, never experiment on race day - so was prepared for failure.

This was a very low key and small event, much smaller than I was expecting.

New PB by 6 MINUTES and 3 second!!! More deets coming soon.
