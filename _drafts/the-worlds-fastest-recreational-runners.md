I stumbled upon [this interesting article](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/the-worlds-fastest-everyday-runners/) from the New York Times which links to an [analysis performed by Danish statisticians](http://runrepeat.com/research-marathon-performance-across-nations) on the non-elite finishers of the Amsterdam, Athens, Berlin, Boston, Budapest, Chicago, Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Marine Corps (Washington), Paris and Warsaw marathons, between 2009 and 2014, and then determined which were the fastest nations by average finishing time.

This is interesting idea and the New York Times opened with:

> A new analysis of more than a million recreational marathon participants at major marathons around the world finds that the world’s swiftest amateur marathoners do not share the same nationalities as the world’s elite racers, many of whom come from East Africa. In terms of average pace for its runners, the United States sits near the bottom of the nations included, vastly trailing that marathon powerhouse, Iceland.

... and by looking at the infographic, they're right, however the analysis has one little flaw in my opinion: not a single African or Asian race was included in their analysis.  All of the races are in the US or Europe so the participants are all going to be more heavily weighted to those countries; it's way more expensive to fly from Africa or Asia to compete in any of these races than it is to do so from the US or Europe.  The analysis also puts European nations right at the top of the table which is expected given that 9 or the 12 marathons were in Europe.

The analysis should be renamed: "Research: Marathon Performance Across Nations, heavily weighted towards the Europe and then the US". :smile:

Oh yes, and it's not clear what they classify as an "elite" runner.

I've love to see the how much closer to the elites the non-elites are if several big races from Africa and Asia were included in an analysis.  South Africa in particular has a very large marathon culture, revolving around the Two Oceans and Comrades ultra marathons and Japan has a huge marathon culture with athletes being employed by companies just to run for them.
